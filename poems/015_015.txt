Risk

I prefer chunky peanut butter.  
I prefer to sit farthest from the door.  
I prefer indirect light, with a little shadow.  
I prefer cats curled up on my chest,  
not my stomach, which is irritable.  
I prefer left-handedness.  
I prefer dramas.  
I prefer crew-neck t-shirts and sweaters.  
I prefer the windows open.  
I prefer to see faces in inanimate objects.  
I prefer a little bit of risk, or at least  
that is the box I check on forms: a little bit of risk.  
I prefer to be on top.  
I prefer my coffee black.  
I prefer the facts, just the facts.  
I prefer you not do that, please.  
I prefer to sleep instead of fight.  
I prefer the absurdity of writing poems  
to the absurdity of not writing poems.  
I prefer dark beer.  
I prefer bees over wasps.  
I prefer wasps over spiders.  
I prefer rivers to oceans.  
I prefer the feel of grass.  
I prefer the bowls and cups on the top rack.  
I prefer to keep my head down  
while keeping an eye to the horizon.  
I prefer to surprise, not be surprised.

(concept and "the absurdity of writing/not writing poems" lifted from the much better "[Possibilities](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1996/szymborska-poems-4-e.html)" by Wislawa Szymborska)
