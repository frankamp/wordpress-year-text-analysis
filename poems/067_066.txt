Ablution

Christ the man caught  
in morning light, filtered  
through thin eggshell  
scrim of plastic netting  
day's first-born thoughts.  
Water warms. Steam spirits  
his voice out of his breast  
collects cascading in alabaster,  
beads intimate on olive wood  
skin. He knows the deep  
bend behind the knees,  
the particular crooked  
point of elbow. Water  
pours out and out  
as he counts every hair  
on his right hand, engrossed  
in the intricacy of flesh.
