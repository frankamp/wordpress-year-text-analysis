Then the man I’ve just met pauses, wipes his mouth, and says Indians. He points to his forehead, for clarity. We are eating pho in a busy Vietnamese restaurant in the north of the city. I nod as if I understand. I keep my face to myself. Indians, he says again, shaking his head. Don’t smile. Plus, they took our jobs. No offense, he says, I just couldn’t stand it, so we moved. And here we are.

And here we are.

I bend to the hot bowl of soup before me, hoping for a crash of plates, someone bumping awkwardly into us. I consider pretending to choke. But the moment passes, as it always does: quietly, on to other things. I realize driving home I wanted an ablution: seeking some kind of forgiveness in the steam of the soup. Instead we shook hands and shared some parting joke. As if nothing ever happened.
