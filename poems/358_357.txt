Rosary

At thirty-one my grandmother taught me to pray  
with a complimentary plastic rosary  
left by the Sisters of Providence.

This bright white Christ hung, so thin,  
from her thick arthritic hands, furred black  
by blood thinners.

_Our Father_  
_who art _  
_in heaven? _

I asked it as a question;  
she corrected me, gently  
starting over again.

We did the decades,  
hailing Mary, full of grace,  
until she tired and fell

asleep. I kissed her cheek  
and gently smuggled Jesus  
into my hip pocket.

Strung from the rearview he listened  
as I mangled the ordered prayers  
all the way home. I trust he got the gist.
