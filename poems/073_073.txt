Fruit

Christ the man swallows  
a rusty bit of wind-fall  
apple nestled in the weeds.  
Its flesh takes on his teeth.  
He waits. The day is digging  
itself a grave, warm and soiled  
in late summer. Grasshoppers  
flit and he thinks of eyelids  
in the midst of dreams.  
The apple has yellowed  
of its own accord, mealing over  
in his hand. Rot's a thing  
to see up close, he says,  
but not endure. He eats it  
whole, brittle core and bitter  
pips in turn. The stem he saves,  
a tiny flag to prick his hand  
on the long road home,  
remind him of the sweetness  
and the sacrifice.
