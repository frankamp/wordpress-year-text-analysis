Poem(s)

Grocery list. Movie marquee.  
Recipes. Half-heard conversation.  
Each particular step required  
to field-dress a deer, recited  
under the breath like a prayer,  
for the first you took in a yellow wood  
on the Owyhee. A name for every bone  
and the shape it takes and gives  
to flesh. Shades and flights  
of color. Music and the notes  
it comes from. Or simply the sound  
of your voice, aloud  
or in your head, right now  
bringing this into the world.
