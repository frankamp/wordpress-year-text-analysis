purple rain / white guilt__

what right? is what rings  
as i walk away  
a couple bucks in a jar  
a black man his guitar  
and a drummer jamming  
out Prince covers  
to a lunch-time crowd  
that could care less

i wish i'd shaken hands  
learned their names  
heard a little more  
than the songs they love  
but no-guilt toting fear  
swoops in to ruin the moment  
what right? walk on, manâ€¦

damn they're good  
and the drummer smiled  
attacking his plastic buckets  
not because of my money  
but for the love  
he was lost in  
the groove  
i'm the one left stewing  
not him, man  
he's gone
