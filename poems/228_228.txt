Love Cat

She's silent until she cries  
to be fed. She eats greedily.

She publicly licks herself  
in the most awkward places.

She cannot be approached directly  
but must be lured, coaxed.

She often looks surprised or guilty  
or both.

She comes to us on her own terms.

She makes us yell and curse  
and at our worst we swat at her,  
wish her dead and taxidermied.

She always comes back.

She'll vomit up blood; she'll kill a bird  
for us.

She growls low to warn; she uses her claws when necessary.

She swirls around our legs and hands,  
butting up, not taking no for an answer.

She invades our space.

She rests on our chests and matches heartbeats.

She races around the house for no reason.

She looks at us as if we're stupid, as if she feels sorry  
that we don't quite get her.

She sheds as easily as breathing. We find her everywhere.
