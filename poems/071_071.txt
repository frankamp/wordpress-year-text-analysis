Witness

Christ the man sobs  
with such luxuriant abandon  
it sets the neighbor dogs to.  
Kitchen conversations pause  
and lawn mowers sputter dead.  
Afternoon passers-by tent  
hands as shade for eyes  
in witness of this front-porch  
unraveling. The sound is a  
lamentation not wholly born.  
His beer bottle sweats a ring  
on the stoop in solidarity  
while the flower bed,  
freshly mulched and turned  
as somewhere church choirs sang,  
gives off the warming smell  
of promise. He wipes his nose  
and red-eyed sees the small  
part of his world-ordered  
streets, a litany of jays, the dogs  
given to their lounging, quiet now  
-and knows that it is good.
