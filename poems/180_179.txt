Mine

I won't drag the pickaxe any farther.  
I've left the gear for you  
at the bottom of the shaft.  
The lights are ready. The seam  
is sunken in the rock, waiting  
for you to sing it out into your pail.  
I am not of the dark and huddle  
as you are. I am not meant to stoop  
in the service of the gleaming things.  
My lips need salt and air. My eyes  
are made for more than the djinn  
you conjure out of the black dust.  
You are geared for swing and hack  
for all the movement of a scythe  
made of muscle. I will wait for you  
above ground as you force yourself  
upon all the surfaces of the earth.  
Subdue it lest it subdue you.  
Until at last it does.
