Ghazal

We come to love and end in fight. So it goes.  
The bands of love are loosed tonight. So it goes.

Dog is off his chain. The hen has flown her coop.  
Rat has slipped his cage, squeaking fright. So it goes.

In the hospital bed the blind boy is not  
mourning his newfound loss of sight. So it goes.

Autumn drags its heavy chains; bitter winter  
fells just-ripe apples lost to blight. So it goes.

I had once a white-hot fire in a bowl  
this cup of flame burned out, lost light. So it goes.

This ghazal is a new attempt at old forms;  
ancient Persian poetry, marred. So it goes.
