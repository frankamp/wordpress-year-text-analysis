Blackberry

despite the heat we have  
no orange trees  
like Thich Nhat Hanh  
to eat from  
take instead the fruit  
off the vine  
weaving between spines  
pluck one plump berry  
black and shining  
cloistered in cupped hands  
a censer crushed slow  
against the teeth  
tasting sweetly sour  
blooming in the mouth  
a moment drawn  
forever
