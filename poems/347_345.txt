焼きそば (Yakisoba)

This bowl of noodles thrown  
together with carrots, ginger, shitake,  
slivered beef, sloshed in a slurry of spice  
and sauces. A chaos of taste and color  
erupts out of small bowls emptied.  
_Mise en place_ in Japanese  
fools Google into _introduction_,  
which tastes so appropriate  
paired with chilled _sake. _  
My tiny kitchen opened up  
by scallions on the bias, _tamari_  
and a hint of toasted sesame, lingering.
