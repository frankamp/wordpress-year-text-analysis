Dream

Christ the man slings  
into the knotted hammock  
a hurled stone.  
The spruces sway.  
Their blue song lulls  
him to sleep. He dreams  
fitful and smokey.  
An ache in his belly,  
a moth in his mouth. Caught  
in a webbed net, a garment  
creeping seamless  
as ivy in the trees.  
He wakes disheveled,  
dry-mouth, unwell  
under a blue sky  
he blinks to believe  
but cannot see the ends of.
