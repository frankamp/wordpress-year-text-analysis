Advent

Holy Spirit is playing it cool-  
no fire, no prophetic voice,  
just wind over water, just  
these black scratches  
and the groaning they make.  
Whole world groaning.  
What to be done but wait?  
March, holler, get sent up?  
Maybe. Made a martyr? No  
good comes. Only more groaning  
noise-making waiting on an answer,  
return, cashing in these chips.  
Wait patient, expectant breath  
held, knees bent, palms up.
