Dam (for H.C.)

Nights such as these  
when an absent airplane  
keeps me awake, nervous  
carving its way through the dark

I wish for a hermit's beard  
a thick, crazy-making beard  
and bushy, bulging eyebrows  
white, to match

A symbol  
something to excuse  
the way I tinker, worry  
my fingers over my knee  
in old-man fashion

Such nights as these I leave a lamp on.

I dig out old Hayden Carruth  
a book of his last poems  
I pour myself several fingers  
of whatever's on hand

I wait for the plane noise  
to fade, the hole it makes  
to close

The warmth comes slowly  
I settle in  
to Hayden's voice  
as I imagine it

After a while I let the guards off  
Take it easy on me, boys, I say  
to myself  
All posts abandoned  
what comes, comes

Not much fit  
to be recorded or recalled  
in the bluebird light  
of day, but some

And that is enough  
to begin to build  
the dam  
against the next night  
and the next
