Ransom

Christ the man offers  
to pick up the check,  
quick-draw to his hip,  
but she declines. As always  
he lets her. She worries  
up a flock of crows  
to nest in her hair.  
He draws idly on a napkin.  
Their smiles always overlapped.  
He speaks in uncertain terms  
of things to come,  
his finger finding the edge  
of the cup. Her eyes trace  
uncertain grain splitting  
the table between them,  
seeking to find where  
she might dig it up,  
this root of contention.  
Her earrings scatter sun  
spilling treasure as ransom  
but she knows as well as he  
there is nothing other to be done.  
There never was.
