Crown

Christ the man smokes  
a hand-rolled cigarette  
with the kid at the bus stop  
since he offered. He hears  
about neck tattoos covering  
bruises, about sleeping in  
the waiting room, about mornings  
made of shaking hands.  
He learns the shape and weight  
of what Gabriel carries,  
if that is his name  
stitched above his heart.  
The smoke demons his lungs  
and stains his fingers.  
He crushes it beneath his heel  
but will wake tasting it,  
his mouth sour and stale.  
It will burrow into his clothes.  
He will learn to wear it  
like a crown.
