Handkerchief

You're bloodshot, exhausted, late  
from LAX but don't want to go home  
quite yet. Your grieving looks like  
telling the story of it: the awkward uncles,  
questions about cash, the haggard  
rattling at the end, a procession  
she would have been proud of. Like: worrying  
the paper label into tatters, stripped  
from the cool Heineken bottle  
like the handkerchief you found  
amid the mismatched plates,  
the ancient clothes and financial papers,  
a stuffed armadillo you'd never seen,  
the doll collection that's haunted you  
for years. All of it left behind to sort  
and save or give away. But this  
you kept, monogrammed in her color  
at the corner, a faded, musty smell  
but reminiscent of her perfume  
that reminds you what it is  
to lose. She's at peace, you say  
you know, but you're afraid  
of the day you pull it out  
of some forgotten drawer  
and it only smells like you.
