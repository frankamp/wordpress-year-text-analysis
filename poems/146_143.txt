Marrow

Twelve turkey vultures keened  
and circled their spiral  
staircase slow eyes on the dog  
hunting with us the dead  
wood and snags along the bank  
in this empty land of rim  
rock and closed oases, hidden  
but for their eyes.  
The bone I packed in  
on my hip, deer joint  
pried loose last fall in autumn's  
pale glow. Gleaming Bowie blade.  
Flesh weighted, packed up, hauled out  
in shifts, a last remnant for the dog to gnaw. I thought  
of them at the fire, the twelve,  
and their fine feathers  
we found, gathered in light  
handfuls, burned as tinder.  
Each brittle hollow filled  
with guttering blue heat  
held in place a moment longer  
before leafing fully into flame  
sending sparks out up  
into the emptiness above.
