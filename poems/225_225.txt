Seagulls

I'm pinned down by seagulls  
and the weight of gold  
in their feathers

I flap my arms  
to soar and find myself  
in the sand

The surf in my ears

Ghostly feet glimmer  
at the tide line then vanish  
in a breaking breath

This is a dream I'll have again

once for each grain of sand  
once for each fallen feather
