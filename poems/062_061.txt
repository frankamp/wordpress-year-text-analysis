Fireworks

I've been trying to set off fireworks  
all night, flicking the Zippo  
with a cool nonchalance, swaggering  
to the MGD bottle in the driveway  
jammed with a bouquet of bottle rockets  
lighting the quick rat-tail fuse I rigged up  
waiting for the thousand screams  
& hot-pop explosions corkscrewing  
over the neighborhood, landing on roofs  
freaking out the resident dog population  
waiting for my friends taking cover  
in the garage to high five me  
because, dude, so awesome, right?  
I was even ready to get arrested  
to spend the night in the clink  
for the story (and all the glory  
it would bestow).

But all I have is this  
stupid little charcoal snake  
I found in a wet-bottomed box  
in the basement. It sparks small  
and smokes, burns itself into itself  
a small black turdlet unspooling  
all over the driveway. It leaves  
a stain and inspires not one  
of my friends who isn't here  
to watch. It's just a pile  
of ash, in the end. I think  
to wash it off, but leave it  
to blow away with the wind  
mix in with the neighbors' roses  
fertilize the dead  
grass under the shade tree  
where I'll sit tonight  
and watch the stars instead.
