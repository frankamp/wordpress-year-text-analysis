Medallion

Don the hand  
from the remains  
of the crater.

Find shrapnel to pierce  
and thread twine  
through the thick wrist.

Second heartbeat claps heavy  
against your chest  
when next you run to shelter.

Phantom-flex of the dead  
fingers reach out  
to all you pass.

Hammered ring glints  
gold. A little fire  
huddled in the dark.
