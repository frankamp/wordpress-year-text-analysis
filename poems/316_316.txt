Blessing (Winter)

It is the time for snow  
On street-parked cars  
And the shoulders  
Of mountains time  
Of sharp-angled sun  
Low in the sky of apples  
Carrots parsnips crisp  
The time of Thanks  
And Feast of early dark  
Of corded wood of sap  
And juniper smoke of gin  
Soaked berries and drunk  
Jays fighting themselves  
In the pickup’s mirrors  
Of Rabbit’s warren and  
Bear’s disappearance  
It is the time of late stars early  
Of long-standing moon  
Of thick candles barleywine  
And whiskied nights of stories  
Woven strong of sleep over all  
It is the time of dreams
