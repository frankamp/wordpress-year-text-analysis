Altiplano

Ugly truth arrives  
half-empty Bohemia bottle  
whistles disbelief

rage shatters glass  
brown-blown  
imploding binary star

carved on the wall  
of a nowhere  
altiplano cantina.

Field horses  
raise naggled heads  
in the sourÂ  wind.

Apologies are anguished  
litter; semantic glass  
only nuzzles deeper.

World of men abandoned  
for the emptiness  
of dirt and grass

and the animal  
instinct of herd  
and scent.

Her hands mark  
tattered manes,  
bloodied muzzles

close, bulk warm  
against her own  
stretched neck.

She knows of hobble.  
Half a world away  
plans fold all wrong:

a useless map  
of a city she's never seen  
buried in a lost pocket.

The shared key  
broken off  
in the lock;

the common address  
on a street with a name  
she can't recall

and would not  
return to tonight  
if she could.

She curls  
in the far corner  
of the pasture.

The herd gathers.  
Long bodies  
and all seeing eyes

make vigil;  
she sleeps  
as they sleep

under sky,  
a standing circle  
ringed around her.
