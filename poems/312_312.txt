Blessing (Lourdes)

A line of white robes  
penitents broken  
by the streamside  
each and every a lily  
billowing atop the deep  
blue of the Holy Font

Each pause in prayer  
dip a finger, mangled  
toe, scoliosis shivering  
beneath the healing  
waters like wine  
upon twisted tongues  
the dumb lift shriveled hands  
in loudest praise
