NYE

How do we approach an end  
that is, in fact, not?

*

We’ll glitz around tonight  
champagned and fluted, reveling

in the last gasps of what the year was  
and was not. We’ll reminisce,

bloviate, apologize and  
obfuscate. There’ll be fondue

and crudité. We’ll play  
pin the tail

on the donkey, the ass’s head  
gotten by some quick devilry.

We’ll cry _Wassail!_ and bless the trees  
out in the frozen yard.

We’ll drink too much  
and dress in drag

flying what secret flags  
we hide away.

It will all be games.  
Until

at a certain moment,  
someone will shout for quiet

and we’ll all gather round  
to watch

a lighted ball descend  
in Times Square.

We’ll count down  
_en masse_, on mute

the ending  
and beginning

of it all, looking  
for all the world

as if we never saw it  
coming.

How sad and lovely.  
How very human.
