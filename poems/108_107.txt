Maundy

Christ the man rolls  
up his sleeves and jeans,  
kneeling in the dark.  
Frankincense blooms  
in a bucket of hot water.  
The others, his brothers  
ringed in a circle, breathe  
deeply, deeply unsure.  
A silent nod and he begins.  
Heels, nails, the space  
between the toes. His hands  
are firm but gentle, cleansing  
with intention. He blessses  
each man, thanking him  
for being served. And the next.  
And the next. And so on.  
It goes on all night. It goes on still.
