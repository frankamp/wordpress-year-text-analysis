Time

Christ the man rises  
at the wrong right hour.  
At the near curve of the earth  
Arizona catches up  
to the rest of the country.  
Or maybe it's the other way.  
The birds aren't up yet  
and a hundred thousand faithful  
are early to church. His body  
is unexpectedly static  
and out of tune.  
In the lagging dark  
he sets about resetting  
the oven and microwave  
clocks. The VCR is harder.  
The blinking green numbers  
bend, send him into _déjà vu_,  
displaced in time. Or out. Whatever.  
He lingers in the freeing gap,  
at home for once, for a moment.  
He declines to wind his watch.
