Memorial Day

Remember, please: we wave  
many flags woven  
from many fabrics.

Not every with stripe  
or star. Not each planted  
on the moon.

We raise our own  
tattered glory  
on a bent pole

not in solemn salute  
commanding  
respect or sorrow

but a tender hand  
at sunset  
shading the eye

to see  
what each of us  
lets fly free.
