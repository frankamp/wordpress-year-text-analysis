Milky Way

a ticker tape parade  
through the city center  
in a shiny convertible  
waving & cheering  
& carrying on but  
for the confetti

hanging unmoving  
a field of paper stars  
that refuses to fall  
I can nearly touch  
& brush  
sharp edges denying  
gravity

the crown I expect  
to wear, pick from my hair  
doesn't settle doesn't come  
suspended in a pale belt  
just out of reach

the brass band sounds  
far away & underwater  
celebrating something other  
spectators vanished  
without concessions  
no stray dogs to wander

with me  
the empty heart  
of the city evacuated  
but for cut-up stars  
glowing overhead
