At This Difficult Time

I hate Enrique because he's calm  
and unexceptional, like he's helping me  
order pay-per-view or cell service.  
Who the hell up sells sympathy bouquets  
anyway? We're nearly there when he bumps up  
to a lovely arrangement-roses, lilacs, the works-  
and crystal vase for only twelve bucks more.  
Who I am to haggle over a dead woman's flowers?  
It's perfect, that linchpin of grief twisted just so  
that you bleed a little extra, especially after  
he so helpfully gave me the words for a card  
I didn't think I'd need: At_ this difficult time_,  
he softly intoned,_ we're thinking of you_. Sold.  
I stuck to my guns and bid him down. Hooray.  
Soon some woman out in Mill Plain  
will receive an unexpected, econo-bouquet  
from someone she didn't know her mother knew.  
I hope it's lovely.
