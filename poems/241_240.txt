#TBT

No photos but stories  
pulled out of the air  
at the picnic table.  
Pints help. Lore  
carried for years, spun  
like sugar gone hard  
at the back of the drawer.  
It'll break your jaw  
if you bite too hard.  
Let it dissolve into the blood  
as the best stories do. Sharp cystals  
cut a little, mainlining  
straight to the ticker. Sticks  
and stones and breaking bones.  
And above it all that big rock candy  
mountain looming.
