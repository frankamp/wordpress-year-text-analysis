Cigarette

is of French extraction,  
which you’d think would light up  
his colonized mind, but  
his borders have been crossed  
so often he can’t remember  
the words he comes from.  
His native tongue’s locked up.  
Every idiom is wrong, syntax  
clashes, grammar runs against  
the olive wood grain.  
There is no mint, no yellow cumin  
in his speech. He smokes cheap  
tobacco in the yard, smuggled  
dry Virginia leaf, Marlboros  
that smear his fingers,  
stain the crescent moons hung  
under his nails. He daydreams  
figs and dates, a little hash,  
hot sand so far from the blue  
of concrete blocks. At night he lies  
in his small cot, a boat  
among all the other boats, floating  
down the Nile of his mind, knowing  
every tree and bird, waiting for the stars  
so he can call them each by name.
