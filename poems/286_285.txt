Lot Recalls

His eldest daughter finds him  
in a dazed state, and the child, Moab,  
crying in the dirt, bloodied about the mouth,  
the old man bent at the waist, breathing  
heavily, staring at the ground glassy-eyed,  
a childâ€™s toy clenched in his withered hand,  
a small carving cut from rock salt  
sold by peddlers, pale and pink-grained,  
a statue of some vague human form  
shot through with afternoon sunlight, casting  
a long ache of shadow across the threshold,  
lurking at the cave-mouth, her father muttering  
to himself, staring not at the shadow,  
but farther afield, off across the plains,  
towards the setting of the sun.
