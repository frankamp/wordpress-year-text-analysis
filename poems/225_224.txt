Storm

Camped out on the porch waiting  
on a threatened thunderstorm  
that won't show.

Just some speckled rain turning  
broke-neck grass and briquets  
the scent of wet pavement.

Fake-out.

Look to miss the empty sucking breath  
between the streaking sheet and clap.

Flag’s a dead blossom. Dog’s legs  
splay out, twitching. Neighbor’s gaggle  
swished indoors an hour ago.

Bees don’t mind the calm, laced and floating.

Settle in and see what comes.

Study at the mangled stump  
some fool took a saw to  
in a fit of quick gumption.

Ruled over and subdued it,  
hacked down its dying crown  
to an awkward stump.

Good for nothing now but a birdhouse, maybe,  
a lashing for a forgotten, knotted hammock.

Its single cut-eye wallows, weeping  
sap, staring out at nothing;  
it’s bigger, badder all-yell mouth–

a badly angled cut that took its healthiest limb–  
calls out at all comers, all hours.  
It’s waiting, too for a storm

that never comes. Think silver iodide,  
Zeus on a bender. Think sucker punch  
of summer, crinkling heat without a breath

of air to tickle at. Caught down in the belly,  
lower than. Scritch the dog behind her ears,  
suck on a dusty stone.

See what comes yet of the sky and all its purple swagger.
