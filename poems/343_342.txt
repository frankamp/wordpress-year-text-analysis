The Torture Report

John McLaughlin must have had has his hands tied

(metaphorically) steering around issues of ethics, driving at law and national security

lamenting making a "few" "terrorists" "uncomfortable" for "a while"

I (metaphorically) add my (literal) moral outrage to a stack of junk mail

at a dinner party of mixed company I mention the "so-called" Torture Report

and am (metaphorically/literally) brushed aside

somewhere a (literal) man hangs from his one good wrist
