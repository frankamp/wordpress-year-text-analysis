Blessing (Blind)

I speak of thee  
with blind tongue  
empty echoing head  
voice of no knowing  
who was and is  
and is to come  
I hold open empty  
hands full of wind  
wheat chaff dust  
I am wholly open to  
what is and was  
is to come again  
when? I speak  
of thee I know not  
of what I speak  
to hear you your wind  
in my voice of no knowing  
still knowing more  
inside my blindness
