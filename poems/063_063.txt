King Cake

Here we are on the edge  
again. Lenten desert  
of unleavened emptiness.  
But not yet: bake off  
the last of the good fats  
lest they spoil. Fold in  
the sugar and the Baby,  
twist the dough. Dust it  
with royal color. Pour out  
the wine and spirits  
as you toast to the end  
of all merriness, holler  
the season’s last hallelujah.  
See your ashes are in order,  
for tomorrow we die  
the first of many small deaths.  
But not yet, no! Feast  
one final time. Raise a glass  
and savor the _gallete des rois_.  
Let the plastic savior gentle  
against the back of your teeth;  
taste the sensation  
you’ve swallowed something more  
than bread and wine. Live tonight  
for tomorrow we die.
