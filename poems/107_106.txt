Bistro

Christ the man thinks  
of the things he could burn  
thirty bucks on. Beer and cigarettes.  
A tank of gas. New pants. A hot shave  
and haircut. A decent bottle  
of cologne. Happy hour  
for two. Nowhere special.  
A cheese board with crusty bread,  
green olives, good red wine.  
Some out of the way bistro  
to talk honestly with a friend,  
lay everything out between them  
on the small table. Look hard  
at it. Come to some decision.  
Or he could give it away  
to the poor and hungry,  
to the endless needy  
who have neither bread or wine.
