Peaches

Neighbor Kate  
once wrote  
a poem about  
the slim V  
of skin found  
at the neck  
in a sweater  
and how peaches  
tinned in syrup  
have a way  
of sliding down  
the throat, so cool.

It was a poem  
about so much  
more than peaches  
or skin, about  
the chill that comes  
with both.

I see her pass by  
in the evening  
with her dog, as if  
no magic trailed her.  
We wave and say  
hello and ask after  
the other and the world  
we each keep stays  
our own.

Lost on the porch  
with the crickets  
and moths battering  
the late light of summer  
I watch the neighbor  
-hood fall into relief.  
I can still taste  
those peaches, so cool  
and so sweet.
