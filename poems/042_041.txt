Jackal

I ate at them with my eyes.  
Devoured their disease.  
I breathed their stale scent,  
their smoke and sepsis.  
I picked apart worn stories.  
I sat close, hand in jaundiced hand,  
slow pulse still kicking in the wrist.  
I asked after kids and family  
that never came. I searched  
sunken eyes. I could almost  
taste it. Almost. No bones to gnaw  
but memory: Willy's glossy black arm  
the flat of his brittle bones nestled  
in a faded red sweater. His neat fingernails.  
The dying ficus. Withered balloons. Heavy  
afternoons barely living in that house.  
I left by the backdoor.
