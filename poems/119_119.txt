A Startling Question

Is it auto-  
cannibalism  
if you chew  
the skin  
of your fingertips  
or bite  
your nails  
down to the quick  
as I sometimes do  
when frightened  
or nervous  
or angry  
or bored in a meeting  
or driving long distances  
or watching a movie  
or surviving wedding toasts  
or floating down a river  
or talking with a friend through his troubles  
or thoughtfully  
composing a poem?
