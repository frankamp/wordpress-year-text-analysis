Christ the man poses  
on an empty pier,  
alone but for the waves.  
His right arm cranes away,  
angling to swallow the whole  
Pacific rolled out behind,  
his face forever imposed upon it.  
Salted wind and crying gulls  
will not appear. No proof  
of the thousand steps  
smothered beneath the surf.  
A clutch of pale sand scooped  
into a jar meant for preserves;  
a pearled shell the home  
of some vanished body;  
bits of pale blue glass  
smooth as water.  
These he keeps for the mantle altar.  
The cock-eyed image of Christ  
the man, awkward icon,  
badly lit and out of focus,  
taped to his morning mirror.  
The face looking back  
at the face, as into a sea  
unending.
