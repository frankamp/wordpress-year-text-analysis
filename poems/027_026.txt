Parlay

Mission: bring down the castle  
smash its right-sided blocks  
in a heap.  
Light it on fire.

Bask in the glow  
of the built environment  
man-made shelter  
too-well kept.

Run up a new flag, many colored.  
Dream never-seen insignia;  
of no known people or country.  
We are the new people.

Discover in the twist of hair,  
elbows certain crook  
what forms  
have always been.

Find depths' edge. Push beyond.  
Make new maps; commit them  
to memory.  
Draw them again.

Burn what must be burned.  
Turn every stone. Spare nothing.  
Level and leave them  
warm in the embers.
