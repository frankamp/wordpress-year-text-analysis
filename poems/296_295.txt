Some Trick

293 - Some Trick

it’s some trick

dismantling a body

w/out hands nor body

but old Renee was game to try

grinding down the grain

to meet the grain

left at the center

one thing to circle

as the house fly here — material

though not quite — circling

my knee to alight and buzz off

in an instant, over and over

finding something central; or not

to hear Descartes tell it

my parts sum nothing

more than deception

my parts? these

lovely hands, these knees

and the body they’re about

are nevermore mine

than when reaching out

to some other body, some sum,

one being slowly slowly

becoming
