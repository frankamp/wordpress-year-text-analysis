Last Night

Hello again, Shame-Demon  
rolly polly pudgster  
impotent grouser kniving  
finger-pointer _who are you toâ€¦_  
wet fear warmed over  
soft syllabic spookster  
at the edge of hearing bearing  
pull up a chair nail my hands  
to the table as if I had no choice  
down the bottles excess Oreos  
upend the mylar bag for the last  
of the congealing crumbs roll me  
fetal take up residence soothe  
in your wallow welcome home
