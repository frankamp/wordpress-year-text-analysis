We fashion the tool to meet the end

and not, as the bower bird  
builds her lovely nest,  
a grave of accident:  
the childâ€™s bright mitten  
chanced upon in the snow.

The shovel lathed  
and left to stand  
at rest in the cellar  
until called to hand.  
The bite of the blade  
in frozen dirt.

Over the marbled yard made  
of graven images, pale  
petals scatter with the wind, left  
to the bower bird  
to line her lovely nest,  
end to end.
