"The news of you"

The news of you  
waits blinking in the ether  
a glittering fish  
turned up unexpected  
wrapped in the news of the day

I log on  
troll the bottom  
of how you ended  
screen you again  
rerun your best lines

In the world  
where I live  
where your soft body is  
going quickly rigid  
it is a small comfort  
to know some version of you  
won't decay
