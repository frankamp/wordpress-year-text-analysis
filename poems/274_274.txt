Votive

Light a candle  
in the tiled cathedral  
of the bathroom.

Pray the litany  
of _what the fuck_  
in the dark.

Feel more  
than the blanket  
soft and close.

No hands  
will come in the way  
we long for hands.

Swirl the circle  
of your face in the mirror.  
See what is

there in the flickering: smile  
at the little death.  
Take it into the world.

See what fire it starts.
