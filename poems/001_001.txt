New Year's Day

I saw three deer  
as I walked in the cemetery  
on the first day of the year.

I wondered if they’re a family  
visiting long-buried kin, dead years  
before we plotted out this hillside.

I imagined the elders passing on stories  
and deeric lore so the younger ones will avoid roads,  
cougars and men in orange in November.

But no. Everything they need to know  
is written down for them, passed along  
intact and exact. No risk of altered fables

that get the berry wrong, extol the henbane  
or mushroom you _shouldn’t_ eat. That’s us,  
relying on faulty words to keep ourselves alive.

And I? I am death to them, a threat  
they turn a wary ear toward  
even as they graze, knowing

in a way I never will, death comes.  
All they want is a dandelion,  
some poa, the sweet inner petal

of a graveside tulip. No note,  
just the flower alone  
bearing the message.
