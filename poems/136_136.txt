Reunion

Bone cancer. His bum luck.  
Never baptized but by rain water  
and bitters. Cigar smoke, expensive  
lavender soap, a weakness  
for pistachio ice cream.

The IV drips a rhythm they learn  
to count down when he can't  
speak. Pain. Pain. Pain.  
Rest. A pasteled garden  
of nurses-Summer, Rose, Daphne-  
tends his vitals.

Hannity gives way to Maddow  
on the sly. Indians home stand.  
The Weather Channel, swirling  
announcements of flooding  
down south. Phone calls made  
and relayed. _It's okay, Pop._

Distant family loiters  
in the halls. His dying  
they take with them  
to the hotel, smell it  
on their hands.

Drinks while the kids swim.  
They take the shape of the sunken  
poolside chairs. Stories surface  
like stones. One by one  
taken into their mouths.  
His godawful temper. His love

of the foxtrot and fine wine.  
The time he ruined the Buick.  
His elegant racism. His work ethic.  
The dog shampoo incident.  
How all their fingers crook the same.  
They laugh and it sounds  
as if he's there.

The kids swim on.

There's nothing to be done.  
House packed and boxed,  
papers filed, arrangements made.  
Waiting in shifts fills every day  
to the brim.

Ice chips. Blue sponges.  
O2 stats. Wilting flowers  
in a plastic vase.  
The eroding terrain  
of his heartbeat.

When he goes it's quiet.  
Early. Still. Most asleep  
or pacing just outside.  
They never heard him  
slip away, passing  
with a wink and nod.

At the hotel they rise  
again. Instant coffee  
in paper cups. Old  
underwear in the sink.  
TVs in their block of rooms  
loud with morning  
cartoons.
