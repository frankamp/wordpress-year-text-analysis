Sin

Simple hunger  
drew the Man  
to take and eat.  
Fallen from open mouths,  
rotting in the hand,  
so quickly returned to earth.  
Lament the fruit of your fathers!

Take and eat and taste  
the bitter pips, piercing  
the throat's soft flesh.  
Words spoil on the tongue,  
worms burrowing  
out of the light, down  
into the dark warmth  
of the dirt.
