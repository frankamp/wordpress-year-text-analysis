Goodnight, I love you, too

We talk around the dying  
fire. You're a thousand miles away  
in Montana.

I see the same full moon  
under the apple tree in our backyard  
but say nothing.

We talk bills  
and the list of chores you left,  
how the horses fare, the cat, the skin

and its loneliness in our big bed,  
lost in the sweep of summer grass  
under the Big Sky.

The wind is in your breathing, sound across  
an empty bottle. The perfect center  
of necessary nothing. The same in mine.

I long to dig out a coal, take it in my lips  
and tell you of its burn and heat, the light  
pouring out of my mouth.

But I don't,  
and wonder if I ever will,  
or should.
