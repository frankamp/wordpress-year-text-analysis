Laurel Hedge

They ruined the mystery  
in an afternoon. $300  
lopped off the Hand of Fate.  
$300 and two dudes  
with a hedge trimmer  
and a pickup.

The wind makes no waves.

So it's a squirrel who runs  
limb to limb. I learn  
blue jay's flutter-hop  
from my back deck.  
Our tabby slinks off  
hidden in plain sight.

What gods we've exorcised.

The neighbors grow bodies  
to hold their voices, alive  
through the naked branches.  
Wreathed in grill smoke  
full of light  
they beckon to us.

What will come if we pass to them?  
What awaits us there?
