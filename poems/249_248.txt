crepitus

is the sound  
of the body rebelling  
specific: when bone meets bone  
(the same)

like what Adam said  
to Eve at the first sunset  
outside Eden  
when shit got real

for the first time  
darkness was full  
of eyes not theirs  
& fear crept in like a snake

spent all day digging  
up roots, confused  
by bruised palms, aching  
arms, and her belly

what a way to begin  
a life together  
for the second time  
against a rock

and nothing more  
makes you wonder: how  
did the first people ever learn  
to worship?
