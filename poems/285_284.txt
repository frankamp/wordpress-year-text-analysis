Jacob & the Son of Amittai

Broken in the bent of anger,  
the trickster diving deep  
to the ocean floor, or nearly,  
the liar hiding amongst the spotted flocks.  
Who knew the whale was a metaphor  
so deeply stirring?  
Who pegged the Angel  
as not just than the Presence  
but a brutal bitter man  
who'd given up his only gift?  
Each fished a hook out of his gut.  
Each laid himself down to die  
and, each, when resurrected, found  
he had no path but the footsteps  
he himself had made.
