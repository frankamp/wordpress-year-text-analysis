Páramo

The underwear I washed by hand,  
rinsed, wrung and wrung, hung  
on a line among other fluttering pairs-  
a united nations of undies-  
stained, stretched, torn, less elastic  
than once they were, disheveled  
and well worn, of all sizes and shapes-  
are gone.

Stolen, I hope, by some desperate commando  
in need of girded loins, or blown  
by the wind into the páramo,  
a tinge of bright color caught up  
in dead grasses, peeking out from under dust,  
livening up the empty rolling brown  
no-man's land below.
