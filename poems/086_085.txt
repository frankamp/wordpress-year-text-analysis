[Romanesco](https://www.fourmilab.ch/images/Romanesco/images/Scr1.jpg)

Christ the man considers  
romanesco. The more  
he slices fractals, divining  
parentage, the more  
perplexed. There is no  
seeking mystery. There is  
no separation it seems  
from spindle down  
to root. Replication  
quick as breathing,  
as unthought  
before breathing  
is what comes  
of divination. Only  
a holy sense of yes  
comes. So. He lays down  
the knife. He lays down.
