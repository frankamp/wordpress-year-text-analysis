Blessing (Microphone)

There’s a certain vortex  
Or sinkhole that tortilla chips  
And a glass of wine at 3:30  
Opens up when the weather’s bad  
And dark and grey  
And you’ve spent too much time  
On LinkedIn or Facebook

When the geese pass by  
It sounds like they’re calling to you  
You’d get up and go find your flock  
But your wings won’t work  
Then you’re just a maniac  
With a broken bell for a voice  
Wandering the streets, trying to find water

It’s easy to sit and sink into the nothing  
Of your own thoughts  
Somehow that’s when the hand reaches out  
And grabs you and holds you down  
And not even the cat bunting her head  
Into your will get you to move

Is that depression? Is that just the state of being  
We all come to when we’re alone too long?  
Unclipped from meaning, lost  
Even if it’s just an afternoon  
That spirals into the edges of evening  
And might not come back

There’s hope somewhere  
Out there in the stars  
But to say so seems unfair  
And cold

(This is verbatim transcription from a poem I spoke while lying on my living room floor. Talk about stream-of-consciousness. Plus I sound vaguely like Tom Waits.)
