building an altar

skin rises up like the LORD said man  
ought to do: fumble in the dirt  
you come from & make me plain  
& simple an altar don't want gold  
or silver and work no stone with tools  
turned to idols just the earth  
I made to make memory of me  
who you can't see, so said the LORD

& I have heard & believed but also turned  
myself into the cut stone a bodied altar  
inked & scarred so (perhaps) unholy  
carrying the divine heart on my sleeves  
an altar still carven in the dust  
I am made from dust that bleeds  
that will return to blood one day  
leaving the memory & dirt  
plain & simple, mounded high
