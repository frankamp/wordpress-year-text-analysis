221 - Sabbath

Not far off the drums of the LORD are beating.  
The faithful pass to crowd the house  
They built for bending low.

& it is good.  
But I find myself tired today  
Of the drums and of the crowds.

And so I sit on this old stoop  
With robins & an errant jay.

The sun climb the steps  
Of this altar where shadows fall  
As supplicants.

I too lay my head down, to a song  
I did not fashion, in a light  
I cannot know the strains of.

I hear the drums and I am glad  
in the City of the Most High there is a river  
whose stones sing a simpler song.

The robin and the jay make home here;  
The shadows pool deep next to the light.  
Errant but not alone in my wandering.
