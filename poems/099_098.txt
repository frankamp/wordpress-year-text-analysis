Gin

Christ the man shakes  
hands in common greeting  
and farewell. Exhausted  
from the effort he retires  
to porch swing and gin,  
to afternoon of silent  
remembrance. Violets  
and rosemary along the walk.  
Names and faces of the many,  
the particular shape  
of each hand in his-like wax  
he holds the imprint.  
His creased palms the same  
as theirs, singing silent  
psalms of fear and shield,  
of hope and forgive. Gin  
-warm he sings low under  
his heated breath, sings  
down the afternoon, his hands  
clasped in thanksgiving.
