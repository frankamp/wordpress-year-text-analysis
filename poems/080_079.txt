Speak

Christ the man speaks  
into the sky. His clouds  
are more than dinosaurs  
and flattened hats. Gold-dust  
bees meander by, fresh from the flower.  
The winded blade is at his ear.  
Many streams inside him sing  
his name. He laughs at nothing.  
His lunacy is sweetly scandalous;  
mothers hushing children,  
mistaking grotesque fascination  
with recognition. What he says  
and in what unknown language  
is lost to air, to the million spaces  
that make up _air_ and _not-air_.  
His speech weaves a veil.  
Gentle your head and lay  
beside him, ask who he is  
speaking to. He says, I am.
