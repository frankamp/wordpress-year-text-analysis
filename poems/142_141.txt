Celery

He must have asked thirty people  
for fifty cents to help him  
_look toward the future_  
though he couldn't see straight.  
I watched him make his way  
towards me, ignored or waved off  
by everyone else.  
Shuffle step. Lumber. Beard.  
Bleary eyed. Retarded? Drunk?  
Hard to tell until he was there  
in front of me, asking.  
I gave him what I had,  
which wasn't much  
besides eye contact  
and a bag of celery.  
He took it, munching  
as he made his rounds.  
He drifted off eventually  
a little more full of the essential  
vitamins and minerals,  
a little more prepared  
to face the life he's in.
