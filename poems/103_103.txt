Palm

Christ the man suffers  
peroxide in the ugly cut.  
Pruning saw bucked  
sudden, caught laurel's  
tough edge, tore his palm.  
Bloodied leaves trace  
a hurried path, wreath  
his disheveled head.  
Hiss and cleansing sting  
rush out. The pulse  
shuddering his wrist  
fascinates-echo  
of his truest self  
bleeding into  
sink's stark bowl,  
mingling brightened red  
and dirtied white, pooling  
a moment in the bell  
before submitting  
to drain's dark pull.
