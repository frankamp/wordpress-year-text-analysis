In the Days ofÂ No Work

i raged  
against the tomato plants  
that first day, raining  
and uncaring, raged  
against the vines rooted down  
in the raised beds, broke the stems  
the blood pulp on my hands  
first fruits turned back  
swung the root-balls, dirt clods  
a mace, cascading debris.  
the rain came. the green zebras wept.  
i built the pyre upon the bed  
they'd slept in, left them their to rot  
back down to tilth, in the dark to turn  
to health. i raged the first day  
and then washed my hands of them.  
the rain came on. the rain came on.
