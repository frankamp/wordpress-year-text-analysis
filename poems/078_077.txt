Covenant

Christ the man stands  
in an urban field,  
a weed-filled lot, rampant  
with equally urban goats.  
A whole herd. He's paid  
several dollars to be here.  
The wind is warm and  
the sky holds no threat  
or malice. The sounds of cud  
and bleating comfort.  
Each bright ear tag  
is a reminder, a message  
to the one who bears it:  
_you are safe here_, it says,  
_we will not eat you, nor _  
_butcher you cross-ways_  
_and sprinkle your blood_  
_to prove our intent _  
_to another. It has been done._  
_It is not done now._  
The people around him  
who have also paid, who might  
have paid more, mingle leisurely.  
They know nothing of what  
the goats know. They know  
only warm wind  
and the soft sound of bleating.  
He smiles to think of it.
