Throne

Christ the man  
brushes robin's egg  
blue on in calm strokes,  
a sea covering the chair  
rescued from obscurity.  
Planed and oiled over  
many nights, returned  
to former glory. A chair  
joined so precise,  
its many curved pieces  
fitted as one body, turned  
from bitten, slivered wood  
to shining second life.  
The work of his hands  
set out on a front porch  
to weather wind and rain,  
to hold him in contemplation  
of the world  
he finds before him.
