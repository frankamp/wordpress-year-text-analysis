Jabberwock

A house divided stands  
in a yellow wood  
at two roads, diverging

You cannot serve both  
God & money—you will  
love and hate both.  

Goblet or simple cup?  
You have chosen  
poorly.

The better angels  
of our natures  
are pinioned.

Even kings  
end up buried  
in parking lots.

Some days  
call for the  
Jabberwock.

Not all  
who wander  
are lost.

Why  
so  
serious?

There  
is no  
spoon.

This too  
shall  
pass.
