After _Prints and Drawings of Käthe Kollwitz_

She meant for them to be seen  
in low light. I tip the votive  
too far, encasing my fingers  
in wax, sealing in the sob  
silent before me on the page,  
ghosts hovering in this dark corner.  
Up front the honey pools  
from a jazz trio, their jitney  
filling in her razored lines  
achingly placed. The twisted mouth  
of a widow. The laborer's raised fist.  
Only instruments: bricks and stones  
and singing scythes. The tenor  
sax, the bass and drums plumb  
the depths. Another whiskey, please.  
Another round to sit and stew,  
all those sharp lines converging  
somewhere inside.
