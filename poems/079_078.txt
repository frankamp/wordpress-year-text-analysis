Auroch

Christ the man wonders  
off-handed, in the sleeve-tugging way  
the mind sometimes makes,  
just as he caps the toothpaste  
about what it means  
to "shed some light".  
His stampeding thoughts halt,  
revealing an auroch snuffling  
in mid-pasture, rutting up the fertile  
ground. Brazen black and horned,  
a shake of its massive, shaggy head casts off  
bits of light cascading like broken water,  
brittle, sloughing into piles around his hooves.  
Like lightening flaked. Like manna.  
A moment taken entirely elsewhere  
by the thought of what might be.  
A darkened auroch made of light  
lingering in a dingy suburban bathroom.  
The flutter of joyous surprise that follows  
hope also lingers, leaving him  
aired out and vital.
