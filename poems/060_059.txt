Heritage

The backyard littered  
with paper entrails, hard candies  
passed over for butterscotch  
and the red buttons of sugar  
the dissolve on the tongue. Taints lips  
and spit. The little devils ran foot races  
in celebration. The oak  
planted back three generations  
hangs its head: it holds  
the mangled body still, colored  
ribbons flutter flesh  
chicken wire mangles bones.  
Before the mob his dancing  
dangling jig lasted only minutes.  
The bat was borrowed.  
Their cackling at his sudden rupture  
raised the dogs. Their eyes grew  
as he slowly gave way. They cursed  
the blindness, the failed stab. I held  
the rope for my own, steady, centered.  
He took the head. Some dirtied knees  
in the rush. Theyâ€™ve gone away, slumped  
against heavier chests, worn out  
by a taste for aggression  
not yet named but seething.  
The cord is knotted tight  
around the branch and will not quit.  
It strained them  
and those who held them back  
along the perforated lines  
where God made us to break  
but not yet. Not yet.
