Ladder

Christ the man hums  
John Prine all the way  
down the mountain.  
Woodsmoke lingers  
in his wildman hair.  
Pine needles line his pockets;  
pitch blacks his hands.  
Slowing over the deep hole  
beneath the bridge he eyes  
each green trout huddling  
the cutbank, each man  
in the current before first light.  
Sun-upped evergreens  
make a ladder on which angels  
ascend and descend. To climb  
into an empty endless sky.  
Miles to go to a home he feels  
not at home in. Below blue fog  
rolls heavy in the valley  
like a snake uncoiling,  
a spirit moving.
