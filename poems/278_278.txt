Legion Speaks

I do not know his name  
or his whereabouts.  
I come from the tombs.  
I have come to know your dead.  
I have come to know the sky.  
I am not angry.  
I cannot sleep indoors.  
I cannot wear your robes.  
I have no labor. No trade.  
I cannot pay for your swine.  
I am not angry.  
My scars are my own.  
Your women are of no concern to me.  
I do not know your names.  
I cannot speak your language.  
I am not angry.  
I am not angry
