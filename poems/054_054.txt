Hangover

It’s been a luxurious weekend  
of friends and over-eating  
late night board games  
red red wine white sheets  
in a bed too big waking up late  
and wondering what to do with the day  
then the long slow haul back  
through Oregon’s central expanse  
(which I love in a way  
I can’t quite comprehend  
or convey and which I expect  
Heaven to emulate—distinct  
but blurred at the edges  
by shifting light caught  
behind tremulous clouds  
and continuing seemingly forever)  
and up and over the mountain

Anyway the hangover  
that comes from bourbon  
in the hot tub and saunic discussions  
about the nature of marriage  
and justice and Tennessee  
Williams strolls through sun  
-banked curves snow-dusted  
lodge pole and rim rock  
and Sunday traffic lands me  
at long last on my couch  
with a needy cat who's been  
cooped up in the house  
and this poem unspooling  
toward a self-imposed deadline  
of another day

But even if I pluck all the right words  
out of the ether about my wife  
sleeping against me in the too-big bed  
or the snap of a frozen sage bush  
or St. Vincent waxing eloquent  
on Weekend Edition—freshly  
erudite, languidly tart—or the dark  
chasm the Columbia River  
opens in my chest, it does nothing  
to draw you closer to the truth  
I’m immersed in but can’t touch

The gap between what I want  
and what I achieve eternally  
decreases. So I’ll finish the bourbon  
and sink into the couch content  
with my cat who demands nothing  
of me or the world but a warm lap  
and the slow steady motion  
of my hand on her back
