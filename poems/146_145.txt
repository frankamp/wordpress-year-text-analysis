Altar

simply _a flat_  
_place_

second horizon  
line

rising stone  
from swirl

stable table  
rock

mid-river  
paled green

moss fuzz  
grooves

channeling  
a thousand bloodlines

lost & found  
set down

laid out  
of a Sunday

over churning wrack  
& plunge

prostrate before  
the Lord

descends  
a cloud

gentle spray  
settled over

the face  
a cool veil

knit  
& simply rent

in the simple act  
of breathing
