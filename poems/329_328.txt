Blessing (RLA)

I don't cry about A.  
until later. I am blindsided,  
his sharp blades under my hands.  
He is shaking mechanical  
grapples me in with his eyes  
closed. We breathe together.  
All our sadnesses the same.  
Smells of cigarettes, cedar pitch.  
I know the bend of his ribs;  
his fingers find the thin line  
of my collarbone. We hold.  
Hold. Hold. He releases  
automatic reset for the next  
blind lunge at love. I stagger  
into a hundred others reaching  
out. Christ's cloak torn. I lean  
to each and every hand as I am  
able. I am not able.
