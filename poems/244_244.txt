Patio

It happens likes this:  
the parable about being  
one flesh kicks up  
as I sweep the driveway  
some late morning, fine dirt  
dusting into the grass.  
The precise intentional  
edge laid against chaos  
of the living earth and all  
it entails. I lean on my broom  
in the warmth of September  
puzzling out just which  
one of us is which  
right then, which one we are  
slowly becoming.
