Good Lord Bird

We came to eat him up, that Tom.  
Man-handled his breast-heavy  
body into the pan. Juiced him.  
Laid in carrots, onion, celery.  
Let him roast all day, steaming  
up the windows. Crescented rolls.  
Whipped Jell-O. Yams from a can.  
Jellied fat congealing. We supped  
and supped again. We argued Scrabble  
scores and _dichotomy_ (ie?). Drank more  
wine and set belts aside. Told old stories  
no one could quite agree on. Pride  
of place: competing pies, pumpkin  
and dried-out apple. We at them anyway.  
Fought sleep, nodded, dozed in and out,  
then _rested eyelids_ slumped against one anther  
on the couch, woke to a thankful cat  
on the counter, picking her way  
through the left out leftovers  
of the Good Lord Bird.
