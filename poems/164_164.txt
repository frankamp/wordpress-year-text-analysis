Still Life with Gourd and Summer Squash

Orange grooved gourd  
nestles yellow summer  
squash's sensuous curve  
huddled in a robin's egg  
blue bowl in plain sight  
on a window sill  
for anyone to see  
where I spy them  
while walking by.

I blush faintly nectarine  
under my collar, flush  
with their brazen coupling  
and the sudden salivating  
prickle tickling my taste buds.
