Massage

Christ the man succumbs  
to hands upon his body.  
Gentle pressure comes  
with violence. Muscles  
tensed and knotted quaver  
against the bone, cry out.  
He knows himself as a sapling  
shaken by wind.  
In softened dark,  
amidst the brethren  
and their quieting canting,  
alone again. Smell of cedar.  
His body comes slowly back,  
all the broken bits aligning.  
So many parts  
gone so horribly wrong  
to make him whole.
