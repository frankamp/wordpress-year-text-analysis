Artistic Pruning

Just a lonely little white sign  
with a phone number  
and such an odd slogan  
alone in an unadorned yard.

I imagined a garage  
full of swatches of color,  
digits and whole limbs  
made of marble or bronze,

entire fourth acts cut  
characters running dead lines.  
Banker boxes of word confetti,  
enjambed last stanzas and lame lyrics.

Stacks of left feet peeled  
from all sorts of choreography.  
Jars of musical notes clamoring  
but for the one full of rests.

If only such a place existed.  
Though it's probably cold  
and a little dusty.  
Just a little room

among old bicycle parts,  
sundry garden implements,  
once-used snow tires  
and a rusty barbecue

for a desk and lamp,  
a heavy-glass ashtray  
and a single seat, a place  
to sit and wonder.
