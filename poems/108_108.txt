Friday

Christ the man cancels  
the newspaper and holds  
the mail. He strips the bed,  
beats the rugs and towels.  
He washes windows, fills holes  
with putty. One afternoon  
he hunts down every loose nail  
and doorknob. He cleans out  
the refrigerator, sweeps the garage,  
scrubs the yellow stain  
around the toilet. He mows  
and edges, trims the hedge.  
It takes a week.  
The truck sells for nothing;  
the cash slipped under the door  
of the neighbor who never liked him.  
The rest of his worldly possessions-  
pocketknife, fishing pole and line,  
several books and cigarettes-  
fit in a box he puts on the curb.  
Key lies under the mat. Linens  
he leaves folded at the foot of the bed.
