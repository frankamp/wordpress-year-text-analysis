Apology

What I want is to say is  
I am sorry.

I know the words  
of apology in two languages.

It is impossible.

I had my chance,  
as we all do,

to right the words behind my teeth  
and send them out as envoys.

I did not take my chance.

I washed my hands  
in a tiled room

and took my leave, smiling  
with closed lips.

I left them to rot  
in my mouth,

dissolving  
on my reluctant tongue

seeping back into my body.
