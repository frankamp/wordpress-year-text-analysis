Muybridge's Horse

Instant creation  
via cessation  
of a gallop learned  
over intimate millennia;  
knowing forever changed  
into floating.

*

Frozen, reanimated  
minutia our limits missed  
and now: the world come  
larger, more uncertain.  
If this is the form of _horse_,  
what more waits for us  
between the frames?
