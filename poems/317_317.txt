Blessing (Snow)

First fall silent  
nearly: quiet crinkle  
sliding down down jackets

deer jays titmice  
all betrayed  
to hungry coyote

every evil made and covered  
dead weeds busted cars  
slash piles gone underÂ 

lie down in the white  
sweep out wide-winged angels  
against the threat hidden

in each flake cut diamond  
no two alike all the same  
falling falling falling
