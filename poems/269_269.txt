I wake from a bad nap  
with a crick in my neck to the end  
of a heavily edited version of The Godfather.  
Brando's bloated face is all orange peel  
and smiles and then he's dead in the tomatoes.  
We shudder sudden and I think we must be  
on a train car in the middle of Sicily, not  
hurling ourselves over the emptiness  
of Texas. Deep in the heart. I drift again  
after awhile, dreaming the Archangel Michael  
Correleone-_in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti_  
A_men_-bowing at the font of his son.  
Fredo, Sonny, Luca Brazi: all sleeping with the fishes.  
And the long slow crawl of Texas unspooling  
and no runway for miles.
