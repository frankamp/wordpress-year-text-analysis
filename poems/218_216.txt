I come to sit awhile among the trees.  
I am still and in my stillness see  
I am alive to what I miss: movement,  
color, light and sound  
fallen deathly quiet at my step.

I am the passing shadow that means fear.  
I sit in it and what fears me comes  
alive. A broken branch, a yellow eye, warning call  
turned to morning song. Stillness is the gift  
that breaks itself.

I sit in what I fear among the trees,  
the moving shades, the smell of apple rot  
and understory plagued by gentle breeze.  
Stillness is a thing of movement, shifting  
with the breath, rising in the failing light.

Among the trees I came to sit and be awhile.  
To shift and sway, a poplar rooted  
less firmly in the bark, less afraid  
of dappled shadow and unseen many,  
at home, at peace, amid the growing dark.
