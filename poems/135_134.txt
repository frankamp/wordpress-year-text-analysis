Kids say the damndest things

They straggle along, strung  
out in a tepid line: big sister, later mother,  
finally brother-son slouching  
through this early heatwave,  
wilting their way towards home.  
The breeze won't  
breeze. No clouds.  
No ice cream, no ice,  
just a spent lime  
sunk in warm gin. No gin.  
They smear a curious mirage  
in the desert of the sidewalk.  
My cat's the same, phantom  
sphinx, radiating heat lines,  
laying out her everything for God  
and the whole world to see.  
The lagging little boy-his ladies  
long gone down to the basement-  
this little boy, who loves my cat  
at every chance, to touch and prod,  
to understand what is _kit-tee_, glances  
up with a nascent thousand yard stare,  
paws corn silk hair out of his eyes  
resignedly, and toddles on with a look that slays  
and says _This? This is life?_ I shrug,  
swill my stale backwash, wishing  
I had a better answer than to retreat  
inside, pour another and find a cool place  
for the cat and I to rest our weary heads.
