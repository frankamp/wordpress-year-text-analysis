Girl w/a Pearl Earring

I tore Vermeerâ€™s girl  
from a magazine  
just her face one thin strip  
uncertain certain full of longing  
dash of head cap blue splash of yellow  
the aged grendel prowling  
my interior swamp died  
a little just a little want a little  
true desire the heaving heart  
beneath it all
