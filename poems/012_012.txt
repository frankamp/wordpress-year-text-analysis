an excellent assemblage

Smooth operator:  
Devonté Hynes.

Best ever or the worst:  
success or possessions?

Unanimous: underestimating  
strangers tweet.

Washington Square Park,  
visible breakout.

Everything is embarrassing!  
Off-kilter, beyond the indie.

His girlfriend? Lou Reed Apollo.  
The East Village burned down.

He lost a few days.  
Exhaustion.

Regroup and look back—  
Guyanese, Sierra Leone, Essex East.

Rackety outfit,  
an uneasy alliance:

The Rapture,  
Work in Blood.

Imagine having  
Test Icicles!

America, Omaha,  
Saddle Creek: room to deploy.

Slightly off balance.  
Too small a frame.

Something in him was unlocked;  
obvious attractions:

overalls and a leather cap,  
major landmarks.

He unplugged  
in late November.

End of the spectrum:  
dance music;

rap rearranged  
the regular time signature,

propulsive feel.  
Daytime radio staples:

Tape and Razors  
(a blend of anxiety and desire).

The real version?  
Homage: frantic mixtapes.

Uncanny, steeped,  
out of print.

Some references are overt  
(Thwacking Nipple,

a soft cloud,  
voices).

Many non-natives  
you never knew

sneak in low,  
sweet

sketch out  
clean rhythm.
