Acts

If one just act is  
All you are able to take  
Now it is enough

Historyâ€™s arc is long  
And bent towards a better day  
You may never see

Work to make alive  
In each courageous act, small  
Though it may seem

Just living is more  
Than just living when we learn  
To love each other

Passive it is not  
Pursuant, awake, engaged  
We learn by doing

If just one act is  
All you are able to take  
Now it is enough
