Night Deposit

Girl, I love watching you puzzle  
out our financial future  
with a .05mm mechanical pencil  
and a calculator from Dollar Tree.

That twisted tongue stuck out your mouth  
makes me want to make the baby  
we're saving all this up for.

College funds. Baby saving plan. 401(k)s.

Let's get down on a plush cushion of down payments.

Let's work up some sweat equity.

With a 3% interest rate locked in  
until death do us part, you can amortize  
this ROI anytime you want.

No line to wait in. No bullet proof glass  
or secret PIN required.

This Any Time Man's always open  
for a night deposit.
