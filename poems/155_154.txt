Moat

I've dug a tiny moat  
with just my hands  
right here: the Q

in _question_: a curling stream  
the tail or stiffened arm of  
why of all of this.

I stand or sit, little place  
to lean, a little prince  
on a little island.

I plant a garden  
with just my hands:  
rushes, reeds, marsh grass

tend the greening oases.  
Gnats cloud, merganser  
peddle up stream.

Ibis cape and land, propped  
one-legged, watching  
heads-under-wing.

This weedy Eden sprouts  
weedy questions shedding  
a thousand more in the wind.

What answers  
gurgle from the stream's throat  
full of smooth stones

clear water  
carving Q  
a deeper channel.
