Thirty-One

Thirty-one is like twenty-one  
but ten years on. Go ahead. Play  
laser tag in the park at dark.  
Drink too much. Have your gluten-free cake  
and eat it, too. Let your friends care  
for you as you puke, just a little,  
in their manicured bathroom.  
Stay out later than is wise tonight.  
Work comes early. Write a poem  
to commemorate. Bones  
and back sore, lids at half-mast,  
heart-happy endure  
this aging body another year.  
Worse and better,  
more than can be known,  
to come. Happy, happy.
