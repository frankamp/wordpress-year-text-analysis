poem of opportunity

the folded dollar in my pocket  
the chewed up dog collar in the weeds  
the kid losing a bloody tooth in the grocery store  
the Hawthorne Bridge in a warm wind  
the glass of whiskey going down warm  
the bend of the river the bend of my back  
the pavement grit in my eye  
the man in the purple jacket crossing the street  
the scrap of verse tugging like a fish on a line  
the fresh feeling after the thaw  
the way the geese the way the mallards  
the flash of a woman I think I knew once  
the lights in the house on  
the feeling when no no one is home  
the hot eye of the stove top  
the movement of steam over soup  
the mewling of the cat  
the collective breath that is worry and relief  
the tidings the night brings
