Low Tide

I get excited every time  
your stomach hurts.

I can't help  
it. It's a sign.

We came to the coast  
to rest, storm

the bright beaches  
ogle the aquamarine expanse

until our heads ached.  
And we did:

the Cape's fearsome  
nose; tide pools alive

with what I think of  
as the first fruits

of the sea; a million  
clouds passing

us in and out  
of sun.

We slept  
sandy.

But when you woke  
with a flutter

of a dory jutting  
your breaking waves

IÂ  hoped  
(I'm sorry)

it wasn't just the rum  
and oysters.

The whole drive home  
I was thinking

am thinking  
now

of pressing my ear  
to the conch

we found  
in our hotel

and its undulating  
sound:

two hearts  
humming at low tide.
