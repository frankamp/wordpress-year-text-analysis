Advent (iii)

we three kings saw

such a one irrational

light some star Eastern

shine down seen from afar

o come o come ye magi

gift-givers sage-seekers

on bended knee find

at manger's gate a gift

of god come down

incarnate simple cherub

we come so far we kings

to find the star alighted

on the earth the shining

come down amidst the ox

and ass feeding the bleating

groan of yoke of sword of fear

held high over all the earth

awaiting some prince

some irreverent unlooked for

king this the babe this christ

we saw we three we wise

men upon the earth

compelled to give of our gold

our frankincense and myrrh

to bow and sing in praise

coming of the star
