Hello

The office building out my window  
is a twisted wreck, a distorted reflection  
of the office building I'm standing in.

I wave across the divide  
of streets and telephone wires and clouds.  
Seagulls fly along unaware.

The city makes its city sounds.  
The people and all their being  
compounded. They are tiny.

They are effortless. They think  
the same of me, way up here  
in the middle of nowhere,

waving at the twisted version of myself.  
If I squint and peer and crick my neck just so,  
I think I see me waving back.
