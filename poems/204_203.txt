Advice  
Dear Anne Landers  
or Abby or anybody  
with an ear and a WIFI connection:  
what’s the right Bible verse  
for cancer? How do you boil an egg  
so the whites come out just right?  
Where would we get 40 acres and a mule  
for everyone who deserves it? Who deserves it?  
I’m at the end of what little rope I’ve been dealt  
making coils around my hand and finding only  
the same empty palm at the center.  
Who am I kidding? No one reads the paper  
or the comments section where the answers  
and slurs and unhelpful vitriol spew out  
to my (and a million other) simple queries.  
Crowd source your life, just be careful  
what you wish for: a once singular thing  
gone viral in the worst way. Christ I thought  
and think and sometimes pray knows  
what’s going on. But then a plane comes down  
in an empty field or a kid I’m blood to but never met  
dies at thirteen. Lives built out of balsa wood  
and best intentions splinter, shudder, fall  
and there’s no tornado around to take the blame.  
Some days I don’t know why I even bother asking  
for advice: I know the answer. Dig the tomb yourself  
and seal in behind the stone. The trick is to wait  
those three days that seem like forever  
until the light pours in, when and if  
the light pours in. Does the light pour in?  
It does, the thinking goes, or so I’ve clung to  
though it may not seem like much, that light,  
just the same as a dirty pale sheet waving  
from the trenches. Surrender, that’s the thing. To kneel  
in the dirt, breathe the air you didn’t make  
in lungs you couldn’t carve, and, despite  
the shit that’s in your teeth and eye, say thanks  
and mean it, true. That’s the only advice  
there is: throw up your hands and see who comes  
when you call, if at all.
