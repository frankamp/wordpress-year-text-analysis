soul (after Descartes)

marinade this meat  
we cleave to and from  
sloshes in. exquisite  
instinctual tang. a ghost  
holed up in the nethers  
neural nooks lost space  
between atoms. a fine powder.  
a kiss that lingers long  
after the press. eerie blue  
burn of pilot light, lit  
where heart meets  
gut meets base of skull.  
breath we take and give  
and take and give and take  
without thought, but  
for moments it is kept  
from us, held at length  
and dangled.
