Pistachios

In the parable  
the man builds  
a house on sand  
and perishes;  
the rock saves.

But the sea  
never ceases  
to turn  
the rock  
back to sand.

Above a plane  
splits the sea  
-colored sky,  
leaving blankly  
as it came.

I crack pistachios  
savoring the rock  
salt and emptiness  
each shell holds.  
Soon I hold a bowl

full of nothing.
