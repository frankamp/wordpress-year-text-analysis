Fatima, who I love

You taught me ghost berries  
one thunderous summer night  
you swore sounded like Kabul,  
remember? Crying into your hands  
two years gone from your mother,  
and no one to keep your secrets and  
the boys who never notice. Empty closets.  
Mountains never purple enough.  
Prayers folded alone five times a day.  
You ground saffron and cardamom  
to keep with you, a pinch of home.  
That night you smelled of it,  
smoking Pearls on the balcony  
counting thunder claps in Farsi.  
My hands were bloodied  
with the berries, mangled bodies  
left for dead. I was alone too.  
Empty closets, empty boys, empty prayers.  
You stubbed your cigarette  
on your foot, took the bowl  
and with an expert flick pulled  
the pith: a pale white pod.  
_Ghost berry! Allahu Akbar!_  
We ate until we were sick,  
red at the mouth  
and no more ghosts to pull,  
no more secrets to tell.  
You laughed so loud  
I thought it was thunder, remember?  
It was the first time I heard you  
speak your native tongue.
