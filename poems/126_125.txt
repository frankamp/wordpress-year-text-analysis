Team Building Exercise

The trainer said,

_                     Sit here and read_  
_                     this page, right now. _  
_                     And let the page come into you-_  
_                     then, it will be true._

So we read aloud this theme,  
Theme for English B,  
us bunch of squares, arranged  
around a conference table.  
Who is this man and what  
does he care about  
what we read or how we think?  
We shrugged and picked our teeth.

We sat and stared  
out the window  
or at the walls, never at  
each other, lost  
in a confluence of thought  
about what it means to be  
a colored student, twenty-two,  
from Winston-Salem  
and that the truth  
might come out of you.

It is not so simple.

Someone finally said What  
is the use? Or maybe that was me  
lamenting in my head  
the paltry power of poetry  
to get at Blackness or Whiteness,  
to get at all that's meant  
to be read out loud  
inside this Theme.

The clock ticked off another hour,  
we shuffled the papers into a pile  
and drifted back to work. Black words  
on a white page, colored, just the same  
as when we came: a page for English B.
