Apricots

Too long in the paper sack

Fruit flies cloud my hand

Where do they come from?

Knife sinks easy spilling syrupy flesh

Glances the brained pit

Bright lurking shard

Bites my sticky slippery hand

Divining a new line in the palm

The cut cannot be undone

Blood mixes with syrup magenta

Pools spills its stain into the white sink

A jalopied ceiling fan turns and turns
