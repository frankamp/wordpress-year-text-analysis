When

What's a boy to do  
when his best friend's  
a unicorn? When his wife  
goes two knuckles deep  
at work but never comes  
close at home? When  
the God he signed on for  
gets rough, like a sea  
he can't calm, though  
he has all the verses memorized?  
What then? When his loved  
brother is sinking, when  
the cancer won't quit, when the men  
locked up are only getting out  
to get locked up again, when the planet  
slowly imploding despite us?  
What then? When wars cease  
to end. When hearts and minds  
are not won, but broken. What about  
when the dead rise up  
and won't leave? When love  
does and won't quit doing.  
What then? What then?
