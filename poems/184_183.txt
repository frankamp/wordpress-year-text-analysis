Wishbone

It's no use arguing  
who pulled first  
or hardest. Who kept  
the better grip  
and who let slip.  
What matters is the wish  
that is shattered bone  
dug from the carnage  
that fed us, that once  
we gave thanks for,  
now splintered  
all over the kitchen,  
lodged in the corner  
of your eye, a tear  
of blood leaking.
