Grace

I don't care about your dead  
phone battery. Your slight discomfort.  
And I hate the way your Spanish shrugs  
out of your mouth, moldy.  
I have such little grace  
for you when all you want  
is to find a toilet, to understand  
the subtle differences of the tongue,  
to knowÂ  if you're paying a fair price  
for the cheap scallop earrings  
glinting on the side of the road.
