Family System

_Wanna know __how I got these scars?_

Any of a thousand hurts.

_My father was a drinker and a fiend. The sharks_

_carved up my wife. _It's a lie either way. 

_Why __so serious? _God

in or out of the machine. _Some men_

_just want to watch the world burn._

_We're destined to do this forever,_

_you and I._
