Legion Returns

matted hair & wild eye.  
scars roped and tangled.  
graveyard shadows cast  
a pallor over wind-whipped skin.  
long-footed limp drags  
a turned aside line  
through the middle of town  
dividing cleaning the living  
& the dead. dogs walk nervous circle  
on their chains. window panes  
glare bright and hard at midday.  
every door locked. for once,  
everything is quiet. just wind  
and the stillness inside  
his empty head.
