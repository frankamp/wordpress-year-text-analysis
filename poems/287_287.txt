The Keeper Among His Hives

Restless after dream, out early  
at the wet edge of dawn, in the clover  
and alfalfa, the Keeper casts aside  
the whitened heavy wooden lids trembling  
with an ever-growl, hidden not  
by smoke or veiling suit  
of white, to stand centered  
in the murmuring swarm  
of drones and workers, swallowed  
by the skin-prick of feet  
and a million tiny mouths  
knowing him, his own mouth open  
to admit of love and holy fear,  
tasting sweetness and the sting.
