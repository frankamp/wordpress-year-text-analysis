Inherent Right

I'm laid out  
wrestling with  
Wolterstorff  
on justice  
and inherent rights  
when you come pawing  
at my chest, seeking  
a place to curl  
and keep me company.

Annoyed, burned out  
by the philosophical  
jargon I'm battling  
to come to some understanding  
of how I ought and ought not  
to treat my fellows,  
plus damn, man,

I'm plain  
worn out  
from a long day packed  
with my fellow man,  
so you are rebuffed  
most unjustly:  
the back of my hand  
sends you off.

But  
how quickly you return  
regardless of my mood  
or inclinations,  
claiming the right  
to your preferred perch  
unaware or uncaring  
of any justice  
but that which is inalienable  
endowed by the Creator  
even to the likes of you.

I hold out  
as long as humanly possible  
against your persistent nudging  
but finally cave (allegorically),  
put down this tome  
and let you learn me  
a thing or two  
about the true nature  
of justice.
