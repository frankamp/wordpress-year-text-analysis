Bitter Fruit

Dozens of mismatched sneakers  
or so it seems  
dangle from a pipe ell  
above the tarp tents  
under the bridge.

I'm sorry I don't  
have any change  
to spare; it's busy being  
clutched by the hand  
in my pocket.

On my way home  
the homeless camp  
is gone. The sneakers  
still hang, twisting  
in the wind.

I reach for strange fruit  
and find the taste  
bitter. My face goes  
blurry like  
in the picture.

Like the picture  
I am always pointing;  
I am always  
walking quickly  
away.
