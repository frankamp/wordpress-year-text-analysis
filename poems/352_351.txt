Blessing (Snowflake)

know the slow burn  
crystalline on your tongue    ecstatic

empty world filling  
slowly with silence    electric

sizzle  
of circuitry    lace-like

never to return    evaporated

from the back of your hand  
in waves

steaming ghost  
released into the    ether

cloud bank come down     settle  
in the low-land

of your throat
