Doppelgänger

a dark lake reaches  
to the back steps  
when the rains come

the linden shakes  
itself free leaves  
floating sunken

bright eyes under  
clear skin our eyes  
reflected there

almond amber  
green eyes look  
leaves lying

a heron come  
to stand above  
himself hunt

the waving grasses  
our hands spread  
stars or fish
