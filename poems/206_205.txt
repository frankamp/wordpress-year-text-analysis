Magic Tricks

I bought 24 bottles of water  
for $3.

Tonight, my cat will eat  
better than most of the rest of the world.

I did not die  
due to the following:

Ebola, gunfire, ground-to-air missiles,  
poorly aimed mortars, indifference.

I take refuge  
from loud neighbors

and awkward social situations.  
My toilet works. I have electricity.

The radio keeps me informed  
and is easily turned off.

Someone else raised, killed  
and shipped the chicken

I ate for dinner.  
I am typing now online

without fear of reprisal  
or censorship.

I'm a simple man  
living a simple life.

What else is there,  
anyway?
