Joy

That dandelion ruining my yard is joy.  
Stubborn yellow-headed joy  
seeded months ago  
by my lazy neighbor  
and her gorgeous Dalmatian.

The gutterpunk asking me for change is joy.  
Shamefaced shuffling joy  
forcing me to dig in my pocket  
and offer what change Iâ€™ve got.  
I make sure to touch his palm.

The way my words come out all wrong is joy.  
Awkward linguistic backflips  
in the kitchen at midnight, meaning love  
but saying only hurt. We come around  
to love again, in time.
