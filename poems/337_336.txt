Blessing (Call)

There’s no cell service  
here in the shadow  
of the mountain. I hike  
to the top of the rise  
to call your name.

Moon rises sly.  
He brings no warmth  
but casts down mighty  
Mt. Jefferson, softens  
the Sisters in their shawls. 

I hear ice in the line.  
My hands blued, their blood  
a thin river, frozen lifeline  
holding on to the hope  
of your answer.
