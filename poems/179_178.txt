Berth

It's a gift my grandaddy gives  
standing Navy-broad  
in my dark berth bulkheading

tattooed arms anchored  
at his chest so thick  
before two packs a day  
and chemo

he drank it down drudging  
a failing Catholic, Christ,  
alms and amen

his horseman years long gone  
barroom brawls and the scars  
they garnered for other men

I get all this by luck  
and certain tilt of star  
blood bubbling up

bending in the irons slight  
those nights become these  
we'll meet on a quay

settling our sea legs under us  
he'll call me sailor, or son,  
I'll be sure to call him Sir
