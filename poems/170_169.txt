Berm

I swallow shrapnel  
with a cup of cold water

shred my insides  
with probiotics and fiber.

I'm building a berm  
inside myself.

My calve veins pulse  
an unnamed country.

When the black star  
meaning _capitol _blooms_  
_

I'll surrender.  
They'll play _Taps_

while the lights turn out  
and the revolution

turns back to guts  
and ashes.

Skin sloughs. Bone  
wears away.

Fibrous twists of wire  
will plant themselves

in the crater that was  
me. New growth

will sprout  
covering what's left.
