I am who I am

Who do you say that I am? Christ Almighty  
what an artful dodge. His wine goblet runneth over  
at a crowded house party, pressed to the counter,  
gently deflecting the question. Yeshua bar-Yoesf  
always was good with a slick finish, even if  
he went against the grain. Never one for straight answers.  
A parable man, digging in the dirt when the shit came down,  
then losing it in a spastic rage. Love and swords; wheat and chaff  
and hushing up the healed. Hard to pin down until the end.  
What's to be done with you, son? Been called many things;  
I've got a few thoughts of my own. But who you are? Hell if I know.
