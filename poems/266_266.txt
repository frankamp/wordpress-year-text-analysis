Madrid

I made a mistake  
getting the _cortado_

She sleeps on my shoulder  
past Palencia, Valladolid,  
into the mouth of Madrid

The car is full of the soft lisp  
of old Castellanos

I appear in the glare  
of the window as a face  
full of all the lights

I can't catch  
or understand

Her _cafe con leche_ has a cold skin  
and will not sit well

She shuffles against me  
shifting my attention  
from the window  
and all that passes
