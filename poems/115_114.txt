The Pea & The Claw

Once I would've cursed the runner  
when we collided on the bridge.  
He cut the corner (or did I?)  
and left bleeding, stumbling  
down the ramp. His frightened hand  
pressed my chest. His face is a blur  
I make up.

Lately my mind is full of this: a pea  
attended to by a shoot, silver-white  
and tailing. A tremulous light at work  
being a tremulous light, lit some unknown way.  
It needs help, I know-how do I know?  
-to survive in the void.

So when I shouted, "Jesus,  
fuck!" it wasn't to turn the runner  
to a pillar of stone, raze his crops  
and salt the land. In that harried instant  
I called down protection on us all, against  
the curse every man knows and its rooting  
claw, dark, digging to unseat  
such sudden sprouting.
