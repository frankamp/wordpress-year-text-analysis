Feast

Christ the man ponders  
the hop-along pigeon  
chasing bread crumbs  
at the back of the brutal flock.  
She's missing her left foot  
toes, torn off or ignored  
by life's dark machinery.  
Peg-leg bird hobbling.  
Always the last to feed,  
doomed never to mate,  
the least of these  
hundred others.  
She knows no other.  
Unruffled, she flaps  
flying into the scrum  
to win her dear portion.  
He leads her away  
to feast on fresh bread,  
a whole baguette, hers,  
for the pecking. No fight  
or flight. Her hidden coloring  
flashes in the sun.
