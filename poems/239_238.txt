Seize

is the one thing  
you can't do

the aura lit you up  
like sheet lightening

but softer, a breeze  
kissed with fire

then darkness

I watched  
your eyes dim

roll wild  
pupils stolen

lost on the edge  
of the tub

your rigid body  
reaching out

I was the only one left  
to seize

(h/t JC for the inspiration)
