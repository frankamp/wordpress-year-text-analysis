Transubstantiation

There is no face  
in the bowl of salt  
only a well  
my fingers made  
salting the delicata  
squash last night

thyme rosemary pepper  
I kept my face  
in the oven blast of scent  
and steam stirring  
the delicate smiles

I am so often caught  
looking for faces

I will dress the potato  
Iâ€™m baking for lunch  
chives pepper  
more salt  
pray over its halved body  
as is my ritual

hoping to take in more  
than skin and flesh  
hoping to taste more  
than salt and earth
