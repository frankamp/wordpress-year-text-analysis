Lord of morning

You made first the cup  
Ceramic thrown by hand  
To hold heated bitter root  
On an old front porch  
Made pew and altar

Witness to the rising  
Sound of no sound  
But leaf-stir soft  
Incantations of robin  
Song and your children  
Wondering aloud  
What's to come where  
You might be guessed at

Flash of hummingbird floats ineffable  
Before the potted nectar  
Lanky mutt shakes himself awake  
Worm turns the dirt in his slow passing  
Cedar and the brewed herb  
Rise to you, praise  
And prayer of a new day  
Robed in mystery
