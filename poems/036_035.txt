I am from

last-minute tasks  
and not enough time  
from chain-greased hands  
and sometimes beard

from TriMet on my left side  
and frogs in the bottomland  
from high rise mid-town  
and southern rental  
I am eastside

from snow flurries at last  
and unwashed mushroom snacks  
from the ever-outward boundary  
from salted prayers and Screwtape  
popcorn with cumin, double-sided tape  
from backpack rap

I am from spent grain  
and rice flour  
single pair of jeans  
from fear of failure  
and love of trying

from horse-people and Baptists  
frat boys and team players and loners  
all in the same room  
I am from swearing in secret  
to out-loud, loudly

I am from no dryer sheet  
from guinea pigs under the stairs  
from a long line of Scots-Irish  
from Native stock  
I am from mixed perspective  
filtered down

I am from the far corner  
the last, best place  
from RCTID  
from a torn-out hole  
in my magazine heart filled  
with cobbled-together tidings  
and poems

I am from stable  
I am from the risky dive  
I am from each of these places  
and none

//ht: Dan, for getting me to write one of these//
