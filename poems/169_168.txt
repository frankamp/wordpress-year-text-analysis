Indivisible

_1 + 1 = 2_ unless  
one is a wad

of gum chummed  
under a desk:

Bazooka Joe meets Tutti Frutti.  
_Voilà_: Chiclets.

Your lungs are lobes  
like ears

form of a  
cuttlefish

to keep you breathing  
here. In the fun house

the crazy mirrors make  
& remake your body

down a long hallway  
bent into ∞ .

We are all human  
donuts. A kind of zero

sum-dividing & dividing  
into nothing

but ourselves.  
(h/t: Ben Mirov's poem _Mistakes_)
