Oh, God

Oh, God, why,  
we've all got our struggles,  
don't we?

My uncle's a career alcoholic  
and sometimes I work too hard.  
This is just your cross to bear.

But hey!  
Some of my best work friends  
are gay and they seem _fine_.

You'll be great. Just don't  
take the Body in your sodomite mouth  
(if they'll let you).

Kidding, kidding! But really:  
please stick to the grape juice  
and don't drink directly from the Cup.

There are others  
to think about,  
don't you know.
