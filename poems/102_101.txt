Hip

Christ the man salves  
the coroded hip joint  
out of true for ages.  
Peter bites his lip,  
holds him steady  
in his anguish. The rock  
their fists make: one  
sunken in the tomb  
of the unforgiving tub,  
the other a ladder  
to cling to. Their eyes  
bind a tether. He cries out  
at the end of his rope,  
shrouded in the sound  
of his own dying voice.
