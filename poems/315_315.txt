Blessing (Cold)

Robinâ€™s egg sky cracked  
a line of white  
cloud of breath  
hung a moment.

Sage brittles as I pass,  
shaking frost. Juniper  
felled at the turnaround  
split to the roots.

If you spit today  
make a wish before  
it hits the ground.  
Teardrops shatter.

Wind dies at sunset.  
Hands huddle fists  
in pockets. Stars fade  
in, salting the sky.

I worry needlessly  
for the deer and jays.  
I should know better  
to worry for myself.
