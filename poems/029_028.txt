Limelight

Cut out early. Duck inside. Hide away.  
Sit the afternoon. Drink cold Pabst  
for two bucks a pint. Listen to Sonny  
and Otis and Miles. Listen to blues  
on a real jukebox the bartender feeds  
with till quarters. Listen to the idle chatter.  
Listen to bullshit stories with a nugget of truth.  
Listen to the 9 Ball break. Listen and write  
it all down. Write down the absent, accidental  
poems. The ones at the bottom of pint glasses,  
bubbling up in the fry-grease, read in the wet ring  
left on the bar. Tom Waits calls them out,  
lone-wolf growling poems into the room  
to bark and shimmer. To strip down and shout,  
writhe around a little. Feel them. Feel it:  
this is the place you become famous.
