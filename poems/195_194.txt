Come unto me

_I'll destroy everything!_

The nightly fight  
at the house  
across the street.

He means it, no kidding  
this time.  
Burn it all down.

The fire of him melts  
the ice cream  
he so badly deserves.

_Everything!_

Like a good villain he negotiated  
as long as he could before  
implosion.

Stamping, screaming,  
rattling every door  
with tiny hands.

_I hate _everything_, mama!_

Is this what Jesus meant?  
We laugh but who are we  
kidding?

Later, when I finish  
the wine or you change  
the thermostat

we'll melt down:  
silently slamming  
the dishwasher,

ignoring each other  
as we brush teeth.  
Epic. Less adult.

He flares up again  
screaming bloody murder  
in the name of Rocky Road.

Blisteringly honest  
about what he wants,  
he's grounded,

sure, but at least  
he won't be spit  
out.
