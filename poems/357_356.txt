Advent (viii)

hammered gold leaf  
around the melting  
chocolate coin  
in the woven toe  
hung with such care  
-lessness the cat bats  
it back and forth  
the tree is piney dead  
duff and dying dried  
to tinder flame gone  
up and out awake  
the sleeping babes  
awaiting father  
Christmas coming?  
empty bottles spin  
leave the wilting cactus  
without blooms  
the cartoned waste  
and unstrung bows  
the smiling cards  
of faces known  
long ago and sent  
by rote what joy  
is in the hurried  
holiday? a font  
of peace and love  
and joy on earth  
goodwill to men  
so seeming feint.  
though star of stars  
gleams bright  
its said hung eastern  
and drawing near  
if sages and stories  
hold truth as dear  
as hope. in this  
dark night  
the soul, mine  
own, awaits  
one promised  
crying as we all  
have cried, groaning  
through the flock  
and brash of this  
the longest season,  
aching for the morn  
to break, the light  
to fall and rise and shine.
