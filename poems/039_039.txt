Cowboy

Creamy broadcloth shirt, Mennonite-make,  
spattered in blood. Like his hands. He looks lost  
under his flat-brim hat. His partner (father?)  
stands. A shame. Nothing to be done. Calf was injured,  
boy. She fought. Soaked the tall timothy grass.  
He's thinking _Issac_. He's thinking _God damn it_.  
They'll drag it out behind the barn and burn it  
on an altar of mesquite and cardboard.  
They'll toss the hooves to the dogs.  
They'll wash up and go back to work.  
They'll have to.
