Dirty Jokes & Ducks

Bed down the year, you  
frozen oaks. I can see right through  
your spiral skirts, branches benching  
against the sky peeling blue,  
two-tone, skimming ice  
like glass in the mudflats.

The left-over mallards are bastards,  
laughing at obscene duck jokes.  
My knees get ahead of me,  
saying _Don't forget the body_  
_is a standing casket_  
in their creaky tongue.

I call _bullshit_ out loud  
to a yellow dog running ragged  
circles around a reddened woman.  
They both stop, stilled  
by my voice and the small truth  
held in it,

though the dog never quits  
his tail, but cocks a furrowed brow  
my way. I take his meaning.  
On the walk home, I compose  
my own dirty jokes to tell  
my wife and friends.

We'll laugh this old year out  
and surprise the New  
with the dark well of our bellies  
and the red-hot flash  
of our rolling tongues,  
streaked with joy.
