'The work we are'

The work we are  
about to enter is the work  
of not being

The beveled blade  
turns earth turns rock  
turns persistent weed under

We follow the leading of the blade  
we place upon the path of cinders  
we are given

If we open our mouths if we stand  
upright it is to make  
room it is only to empty ourselves

We will work the ground we are  
given to make the path we are  
on with the blade

We will learn the blade intimately  
intimately we will learn the ground  
and the row

We will be taught in time to turn  
the earth the roots the rock  
the cinders the persistent weed

The work of this season  
will bury us  
for a time
