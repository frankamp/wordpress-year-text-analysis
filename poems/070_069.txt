Letter

Christ the man kisses  
the blood from the slim cut  
and envelope's sticky lip.  
Tastes iron. Spoons bloom  
in his mind. All day long  
he feels the thumb in a new way:  
distinct in pain, alert  
to the limits healing has.  
The disconcerting absence of feeling  
a band-aid makes possible.  
Each painful throb reminds him  
of the letter sent, lost  
in a sharp, shuffling sea of letters,  
also lost, bearing out into the world  
the red stamp of his hand.
