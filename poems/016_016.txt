//late-night ride home//

Portland

you know I love you best  
when you’re rouged up  
just a touch rough  
cloud puff-puff poof  
night slyly boxing out  
the sun peeping tom

you dusky slinky thing  
a little wet and warm  
full of frogsong & dubstep  
burnt toast smell diesel river mud  
the cement factory shuddered  
stop the stacks gone quiet

high heels harbor Pearl ankles  
glitzy marquee skins Broadway  
headlight glare smears 82nd Ave  
& East County counts stars  
Andromeda of bottles broken  
promises local constellations

your bearded men stop & watch you  
on the bridge your women walk quickly  
away pretend not to notice  
your dark dress a little short hung up  
in the West Hills your stockings run  
down Sunset Highway

I’d light your cigarette anytime  
I’d hail you a cab & pay the fare  
I’d tango w/you until I’m sore  
I’d kick my shoes off & swim to your far side  
a stolen rose stem thorns biting  
lips clenched in my teeth
