Artifact

Fucking centrifugal force.  
Who ever threw a ceramic mug  
with a handle right the first time?  
Or fly fished. Or founded a state,  
say Florida or North Dakota, out there alone  
where the buffalo roam(ed). Or take  
federal holidays: let's agree today  
is the day we do nothing for no reason!  
We'll leave the legislation. Later gator.  
It used to be pantaloons on the line  
and dog fights in top-hatted circles  
and delightfully even rows of corn  
or amber waves of mono-culture grain,  
a quick dip in the pond with the missus  
on a summer night, fireflies that might bight,  
aye, that's the life for me! Now: nano-bots  
surfing your blood and the NSA retweeting  
your OK Cupid profile (pwned!). Next: future  
of cars that don't need no stinking roads  
where we're going, Marty. Oval eyes  
and silver-mesh unitards, giant brains  
hooked into gianter mainframes.  
Tall, tall arboreal cities anchored in nothing  
but dust and trash and a magmatic core.  
Time capsule. Their scientists (ours?)  
root with bionic arms through our plasticity  
for endless crap and radioactive everything.  
Someday they'll turn up an ugly no-handle mug  
with a lazy glaze job and chicken-scratch  
etched in the bottom. Attempted perpetuity.  
I wonder, they'll say, what it is? What it means?  
Some things never change.
