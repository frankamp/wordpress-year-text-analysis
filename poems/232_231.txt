Pythagoras of the Plain

the half-lidded moon  
tips over drunkenly  
covering the fields  
until the rabbits turn silver  
and the crickets quiet  
their bows

the shocks of wheat  
tired of dancing  
list on flimsy elbows  
to drink in the light  
each one dragging out  
a sharp hypotenuse of shadow  
behind
