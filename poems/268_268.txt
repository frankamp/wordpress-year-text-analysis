Keep Walking

Walk the particular path your feet find.  
Stroll past my door now and again.  
Welcome me as I wander late nights  
with a cup and candle whenever it is I arrive.

Walk the particular path your feet find.  
Send updates once in a while, marked  
by the distant lands you come across.  
Use your mind and strength in what ways seems best.  
Raise up new ways of making you never knew.  
Rest often.

Just keep walking, whatever path  
your feet have found for you.  
Wide and well traveled or lonely  
and known only to you, it matters not.  
Only keep walking.
