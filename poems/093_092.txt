Miracle

Christ the man startles  
the ghost out of the machine.  
In a noisy airport bathroom  
the paper towel appears  
with a wave of his hand.  
Faucets and urinals run  
of their own accord.  
The spirit moves. Men  
filter in and out, moving  
in an unspoken dance,  
bearing every manner of dress  
and language, each intent  
on destinations they know  
intimately and not at all.  
They will plane and deplane  
in distant cities  
and think nothing of it,  
complaining of lost time  
or kneeling to greet their children.  
They will step down out of the air  
as if it is their right.  
He will meet them there.
