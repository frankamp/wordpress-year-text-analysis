Wrestling

After a long night doubt crept in.  
A new knowledge  
the Angel had never known.  
Great and awful wonder  
clouded the golden vision  
as dawn came on.  
The Angel shifted his grip  
to break the hip of the man,  
Jacob, splayed sobbing in the dust,  
turning great circles  
in sudden agony and anger at the lack  
of blessing. A blessing. A name.  
He would not release the Holy Presence.  
The Angel, staggered not by strength  
but by will, gave up the name  
Jacob had only ever desired:  
his own.
