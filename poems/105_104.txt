Fig

Christ the man curses  
down the fig tree. Dead  
limbs drop rotten fruit  
on his side of the fence.  
Black flies and bees descend  
in swarm. The hungry mob  
sounds a thousand, five thousand  
strong. A crawling mass,  
a creeping skin of mouths  
consumes the putrid body,  
dumped as if in haste in long weeds  
and wildflowers. What sweetness  
lingers he knows as loss.
