Lymon, Singing

in profile, man inside, eyes  
closed, humming  
in time, then slowly singing, soft  
a tender tenor-high floating  
out of reach  
of the other men stirring  
low, knuckling at the table  
above, tinkling in time his glass  
against the whiskey bottle,  
slap-clap of hands and feet  
on pine boards, rough  
the room built from scratch  
on that tiny stage his hand  
of a sudden held high, trembling  
lifted up before _crash!_  
to the table top  
hymn-singing hard now, sweating  
the sweetness out  
his work shirt stained  
a dark line down his back  
each of them the same dark  
line Lymon singing, tender  
-tenor, high above it all,  
floating
