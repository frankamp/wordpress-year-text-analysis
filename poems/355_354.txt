Warble

In the bleak midwinter rain  
we stopped along the cedar'd path  
to listen. The moss grew quiet  
on the bark of the evergreens.  
The nuthatches, juncos, jays  
you said you new by sound  
were silent. You breathed  
in Latin vapor-_Parulidae, Sitta, Sturnella  
_-hoping to coax forth a fluted call  
from some warbled throat. We waited  
with chill hands, searching  
for a song we could not hear,  
that would not come yet  
to human ears.
