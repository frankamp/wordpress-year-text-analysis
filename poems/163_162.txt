Alamo

My brother's in the wild  
panhandling his way down  
through Tejas-land  
America's bladed edge.  
His sister hails from the flatland  
_de la frontera_.  
He carries dual citizenship,  
crossing freely  
from one family to another  
though not without hazard.  
Coyotes. Saguaro. Leaching  
water into hard pan.  
This northern corner of the world  
runs down, flattens, drains  
of wet color, empty  
but for possibility. I wait  
in rain shadow  
for a call to come  
crackling through the static  
of a truck stop payphone,  
ask him how he finds the Alamo,  
what he sees out on in the endless draw  
under the light of one lone star?
