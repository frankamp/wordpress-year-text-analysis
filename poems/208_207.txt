Exhaustion

is the heavy pipe  
carried in the eye

sawdust lamentations  
of a restless mind

worry grinds the axe  
til dawn

blood-red rust clots  
a bluebird sky

all is sandstorm  
taste of dust

jointed blur  
moment unhinged

from moment  
to the end

of what's to come  
rest

far off bright  
emptiness

a pool  
slowly filling
