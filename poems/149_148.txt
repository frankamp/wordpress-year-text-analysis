A Reading at First United Methodist

The annex's an ugly, open space  
curved like the hold of a ship  
crammed with old mustardy chairs.  
Home to church auctions and prayer  
breakfasts, the room fills with color  
from the stained glass of Christ  
and the saints along the west wall.  
Family and friends who'd never turn up  
here, who'll soon beÂ  an audience,  
mingle, graze, drink orange bev  
or coffee, dunking animal crackers  
only to have the pink frosting skim off.  
Patrick-who's poem is on page 82,  
who'll read in a halting, salted voice  
and stop the murmuring dead  
like sight of land after months at sea-  
laughs and laughs. We settle at a signal.  
Introductions and thanks. Cell phones silenced.  
Polite applause. And we shove off  
into an uncertain sea of words  
and the voices that make waves of them.  
Patrick rises in a crest and descends  
to his seat, followed by others alike  
and unlike. We clap our thunder loud  
for each. Pitch and yaw. Roll and holler.  
Held hostage, shanghaied  
away from ghost linoleum and fading hymnals  
we are willing deckhands, word-pirates  
for a night, leaving the safety of land to sail  
out into the deepest ocean.
