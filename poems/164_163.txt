Blurry Portuguese

the beautiful game  
a pitched samba battle

in the street  
in the favelas

sprouting pirate radio  
spilling blurry Portuguese

speaking Spanish  
with a mouth full of marbles

into my living room  
I don't need language

I get the meaning straight  
from the words

_goal_ sounds the same  
in every tongue
