Counter Work

Fickle latch. Broken bell.  
Half-assed toaster. Microwave  
that works only sort-of sometimes.  
Regulars I've known by ounce  
and extra hot, decaf, how many shots?  
Some by name. Which tips well  
while scowling, which never will,  
then once in a blue moon, do.  
Idiosyncrasies I'll miss  
when I'm done holding down  
this particular patch of concrete,  
these reinforced EZ-Knees mats,  
this small corner of the world  
at Holgate and 28th. Sunrise  
through the bent laurel hedge.  
Tide of TriMet's ebb and flow.  
The million and one leaves left  
swirling in the wind.
