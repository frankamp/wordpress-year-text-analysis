Desert (Christmas)

In the desert  
your voice alone  
touches the rocks  
and itself in passing.

Your shadowâ€™s thin  
body caught up  
in the spines  
of the saguaro.

What prayers  
the ancient cisterns hold  
is water that slakes  
but only a little while.

As if God came not  
into the world, as if  
God is not shadow  
and voice, not water

in the desert.
