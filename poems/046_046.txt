Solitaire

I was up at the cemetery  
when the bridge closed.  
It was a dry run.  
The rain ruined my tux.  
It was a rental.  
I hid in the mouth  
of a mausoleum  
and played solitaire  
with dead leaves.  
A pair of headless angels  
offered alternative routes:  
the freeway was too risky;  
my shoes and cufflinks  
would drown me.  
The ace of spades  
kept on not rolling.  
A boy practiced wide turns  
in his parents minivan  
for an hour. I waved once.  
No fresh flowers. No tiny flags.  
Just tall trees hovering over  
a claw-armed backhoe.  
I used my rented cummerbund  
to clean the pioneer markers,  
propped up their rotten crosses.  
Sounds of grinding life  
on the dead bridge drifted up  
the hill. I asked the angels  
how long. They couldn't say.  
I shuffled and shuffled  
again. The dead leaves fed  
into one another. The game  
went on.
