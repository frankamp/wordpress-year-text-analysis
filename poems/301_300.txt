Cherub

Enjoy those dollar food truck tacos and tortilla chips,  
ye rosebud cheek'd cherub. Linger in the dusky swarm  
of Anaheim's slow prickle. Listen at the door  
to all the idle talk kicked down the avenue, the boys  
in their boots, the dogs circling, stood out at poles,  
the busker canoodling his pickle tub a _merengue_.  
Lift up your eyes, cherub, from the dirty cuffs  
that pass by to the leaning marble of our Lady  
of Truth and Sorrow keeping watch of the ragged lot,  
patron saint of stone, weeping as the pigeons strut  
and scramble for the broken crumbs of milled corn  
falling from your lovely, fluttering hand.
