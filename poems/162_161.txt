You're nowhere near  
the high school shooting  
this morning but  
I call anyway  
unsettled  
triggered by tragedy  
passing by

I falter in the empty space  
of endless tones  
hoping  
for the click and latch  
of your voice breaking  
in

I return to the world  
of solid things

Somewhere  
in a backpack  
or an empty locker  
or thrown into a field,  
a phone is left  
to ring

and ring
