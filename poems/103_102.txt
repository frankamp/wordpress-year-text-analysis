Gamble

Christ the man gambles  
the last of his nights away  
on cards he cares little for.  
It's the men at table,  
the feel of money  
slipping or piling  
on a bluff, a whim  
he deals in for. The turn,  
the draw, the river coming  
in his favor or hard against.  
He bides his time, lying low  
at the table, telling nothing  
while his brothers spout  
and coerce, badger, live  
as if it meant nothing.  
The drink and smoke.  
The long dark hours.  
He cherishes it all,  
going all in at last  
near the break of day.  
The final flop comes  
to tired eyes. A single card.  
He folds without a word,  
that last guarded hand  
a final testament.
