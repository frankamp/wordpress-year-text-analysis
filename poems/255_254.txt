The Face I Make

Today I learned the face  
I make at slow tragedy.  
When Maesie said _MS  
_I said, _what does that mean?_  
_I might have it_, she said.  
And I said, _No,_  
_what does MS mean, which one_  
_of the diseases is that?_  
She told me, waving  
a half-eaten butter cookie  
crumbs flaking off like her nerves  
might soon do. I watched her face  
react to the face I made._ Stop it_  
she said. _People keep doing that._  
_Doing what_, I said. _That_, she said.  
_That _aww_ face, like you're crushed,_  
_like _you're_ the one with MS._  
I tried to make my face something other  
than what it was, brave maybe, instead  
of the sad, bent shape it had, but lips are lips  
and so what to do? The butter cookie  
was mostly gone by then, scattered into our laps.  
We hugged on the corner in the sun.  
Days later I'm still finding crumbs  
in my clothes, a greasy feeling on my hands.
