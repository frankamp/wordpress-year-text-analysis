covenant

the hole open  
where once  
a stone

tablet  
broken

cast down  
the mtn

the pieces make  
an altar

to burn  
to shelter  
to stand & cast  
a shadow

#

rain fills the empty  
nest

a lake a mirror

stretch your hand out  
over

the surface: only your hand  
turned back

on itself  
grasping

nothing  
but itself
