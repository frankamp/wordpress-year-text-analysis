snow

smooth it all out, baby  
rub down the edges  
of street signs, trash cans, hedges  
step out on the porch  
with your Makers and water  
let the fat flakes hiss  
on the hotplate  
your lips and cheeks are  
streetlamp fuzzes a golden bell  
the whole world's gone under  
porch light leaves your shadow  
and the smoke from your cigarette  
the sharpest things going
