Trimming Zinnias

We watch her on the sly  
across the room  
around the edges of conversations  
sitting in front of us

from the thing that happened at work,  
the dog dying, the bad argument,  
that Caleb is finally crawling, my God,  
can you believe it?

to her slight frame  
in a sheer white smock  
pushed up at the elbows,  
the precise clip of the shears

trimming zinnias-orange,  
purple, a spray of white  
angle's breath listing  
in the too-big vase

the water in the vase  
bending  
back the light  
at an unfamiliar angle

the flowers clump together  
as if afraid  
their leaves sigh  
in a slight breeze

with a shake, as if she's done this  
a thousand times, every day  
of her life, they tumble  
apart, the individual bells

of the heads looking out  
into the room, past each other,  
as we are, standing on their own  
the stems tangled together
