hot hot heat

the heat muggles everything

cat dog people brains say: splay  
in the basement

bones soften

thoughts sublimate mid-think  
to rivers frigid ice-block-yoga-pose

DQ waitresses turn tyrant queens

proffer wilted monies  
like the dead  
zinnias in parched gardens

save us Arnold Palmer!

what terrible skinks we are  
buying the last swamp cooler  
with a smirk

eating every Otter Pop in the box

seat belt buckle burns _fuck!_

_will we turn to jelly?_  
O little one-

what love pumps out  
of overheated hearts

smearing aloe on sharked shoulders  
frozen berries like marbles in the mouth

whisper-singing _lie still little one_

sun bungles down around  
to bully another other

sleep off the heat

dream ice cream headache  
dream toes in the mud

dream alabaster ointment  
rainbow sno-cones syrup sweet  
under-porch shadows

dream up a breeze  
and grey-colored morning

dream your face  
in a pool of cool water  
leaking through the sieve  
of your own fingers
