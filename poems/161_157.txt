Firs

skins zippered whole but bearing teeth  
marks rounded burl of sap  
and matted tissues girth & growth  
come w/blood letting weeping  
thick ribbons of loss pulse  
just under seams of weakness binding  
shiver cold radiate remembrance  
in the wind the saw sounds keening  
hairline fractures pinging ancient hurt  
cut each body open to soft inner  
barks bloody read the lifeline  
down to the roots
