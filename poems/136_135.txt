Decency of Tar

The awkward silence  
a flag at half-mast  
we let hang.

The hateful thing  
thought, then said.  
_It's a free country! _

A shameful gaff, stuck  
in a few craws  
on a back porch

spirals  
out of control.  
Goes viral.

Dog shit flames.  
Tires slashed.  
Windows paned.

Anonymous,  
baseless, like the quip  
where it began.

We've forgotten  
the decency  
of tar

and feathers.

Public shame  
served quick  
and final.

Sneak attacks  
are off-hand  
thoughts; endless

flash-mob justice  
meted out  
in record time

(though dubious  
if punishment  
meets the crime).

Twitter handles  
and avatars  
the new

white hoods  
and black masks  
of digital vigilantism.

Forget the NSA.  
Forget PRISM  
and the Military-Info

Complex. Trust us  
to keep an eye  
on it

ourselves.
