Hagiography

sounds a lot like Hey, Geography!  
as if some cantankerous cartographer  
is getting after his tilted-halo child again,  
perhaps for moving a mountain range or  
gerrymandering Jefferson and Crook counties  
into a three-headed, fire-breathing hodag.

He orders the known world.  
His concern is in where, exactly,  
each river runs, less the rivers themselves.  
He’s an edge man, trading in contours of  
stark black lines that define the shape of things;  
the interior is someone else’s problem.

No wonder the kid’s no saint. Or is he?
