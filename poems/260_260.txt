Pictures

When we return they'll say  
we should have taken more photos. Let them  
capture the broken light molded  
to the bent heads of sunflowers. Let them  
press their fingers to the silver, leave  
their own marks in the printed dust  
of skin and precious metal. Let them  
capture the wind drifting gently  
across their faces.
