thinks i can't unthink

when i wake  
at two a.m.  
from the living  
coma  
i put myself  
in again  
you are not  
dead or  
raped or  
missing or  
you are  
alive you are  
breathing you are  
next to me  
your warm hand  
curled in nothing  
but sleep  
but I am  
awake  
wrapped up  
in all the dark  
thinks i can't unthink  
no matter  
how hard i try  
no matter how  
much i want  
your hand to be  
the only thing  
that is that matters  
no matter  
no matter
