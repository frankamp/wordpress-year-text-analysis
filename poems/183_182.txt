Today

I saw a boy bend backwards  
to fit his head between his feet.  
I saw eleven men die trying.  
I saw the taking up and landing  
of many feathered things.  
I saw the golden thread of hope  
woven where you least expect.  
I saw a lonely woman look out  
at dusk searching for the keyhole.  
I saw the cracks. I saw the trees  
and their shadows laid down  
and the people laid down in them.  
I saw the Lord of Cats come calling.  
I saw the way water draws us  
to itself. I saw it break and remain  
whole. I saw the rising  
and the falling of the Lights.  
I saw the closing  
of my lover's eyes and mine.  
I saw no more.
