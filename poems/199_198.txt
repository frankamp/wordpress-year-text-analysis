I am terrible at love  
poems. No one dies  
in them. Too much sun  
and such. The kiss  
that comes is a groan  
to me. But I feel  
a dreadful lovely thing  
hunching its back  
inside me-the heart?  
the thing beneath  
the heart?-bursting  
its thousand mouths  
to say the same.  
It's just not my way  
to say it straight  
when slant and arch  
sting so good.  
The scar's the thing. Love,  
I do, and said so  
once in front of God  
and everybody, and a thousand times  
since to the wind so you'll hear  
me speak when you least  
expect or want.  
That's just how we work  
I suppose: stuck together  
until death do us part,  
though some days even  
that seems a little like cheating.
