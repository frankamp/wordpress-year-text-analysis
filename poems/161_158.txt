Powwow

They arrive in groups of two or three  
or alone, leaving cars in the lot. Weekenders  
channeling a spirit they're read of,  
been told is in them, buried, like a seed  
wrapped in dead salmon.

Dig out the root of the navel,  
pull open, see what sprouts. Lilac  
or nightshade. Bloody Indian corn  
to braid. Fields of wheat, soybeans,  
tobacco, cotton.

Native chanting on loop.  
Beaded vests bought cheap  
at roadside diners. Dream catchers.  
Fireside tales of animals  
giving up their names in fur  
and skin.

Bang a drum slowly.  
Deep-throated chanting drowns  
out the wind in the firs,  
the soft movements all around.
