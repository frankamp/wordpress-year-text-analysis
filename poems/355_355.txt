Statue

When blind Michelangelo carved at last the air from David's empty hand curled at his side, he sensed the end. Set down the blunted bit and mallet. Breathed the dust of him for days, known intimate, marbled on the inside. Begotten, not; made. One man to stand and crack with the ages, one a stone, softening in its socket.
