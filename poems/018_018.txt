Eponymous

Eighteen is hard  
Is fraught is a nut that won’t crack  
Eighteen is acid reflux is hangover  
Is ringworm is Charlie horse  
Is every card stacked against humanity  
Is no moon is a space station  
Is not the droids you’re looking for  
Eighteen is letting them down  
In their own special way is eighteen  
Is suffer is anxious is balled-up guts  
Is no kiss is wallflower is all slip and gangle  
Is hair in the food is bleeding gums  
Is sweaty palm handshake is eighteen  
Is sun kill moon is river of blood is plague  
Of frogs and boils and the first born  
Eighteen is hung up on hooks is mostly dead  
All day is out to dry to twist in the wind is  
Eighteen on the last day of summer  
before the drought and locust and wasps  
Eighteen is a chipped tooth is a fat lip  
Is a bum ankle is psoriasis is kidney stones  
Big as pears is a bruised ego is a shame is eighteen  
Is one long year is all is naught
