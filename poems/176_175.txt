swimming in the dark

siren song: we quit drinking  
to save the baby we quit  
quit drinking to make the baby  
made instead no baby but  
its parts salt water arms  
heart slender fingers  
curled sound of  
no-teeth mouth crying _come_  
_come_ all we want  
calm the fight  
of salt sea  
fists & heave  
never ending  
thin shadows lain  
over waves  
penumbra  
shanty-sung shape  
unthought  
swimming  
in the dark
