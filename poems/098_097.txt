Barbecue

Christ the man salsas  
barefoot across the lawn,  
a soft but rigid frame  
for Yvonne to ply against.  
In rhythm they quarter  
turn and turn again.  
Their laughter turns heads  
of neighbors mingling  
in mild conversation  
about promotions, vacation  
plans, yard work woes,  
homeowners' dues.  
Children join in but  
are quickly pulled aside.  
They smile wide and  
put more hip into it.  
Her blackened curls, flagrant  
as her reputation, shimmy  
in time. They mar the grass  
with Latin flair; rutted proof  
of their abandon. The music fades  
to forced static. She leans in  
to kiss his cheek in gratitude.  
He lets it linger, savoring the holy  
press in her lips.
