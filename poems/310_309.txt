Blessing (Creation)

O God of yell. of stomp. of shout.  
of song. of blood.love.sex.life. bursting  
the seams you laid in each of these  
stone.wolf.fir.reeds.hand.dove.  
trees split. cedars of Lebanon split  
to tangled roots. O God of dark.  
of silence. of still small voice. O  
God of haunting. where are you? where  
do you come stepping? what song  
is in the wind? what lips you make  
to kiss your own. lips. make names  
to utter Name. timbre made to shake  
mountains.river.stones.cedars.stars.  
what shouting! what commotion freed  
from contemplation. make unto the Lord  
a joyful noise, all ye ghosts and beasts.  
emptied full. unthought. un-  
claimed. begotten of chest.lungs.throat.lips.  
break the lyre. beat the drum.  
all things here below praise what it is  
that gives tongues to praise.
