Blessing (Winter Garden)

I used to know you  
By mouth-feel Name  
Of Stones I knew  
Your cut edges  
Blood-drawn tongue-  
Swollen sharp click  
Against teeth You were

A second vine in me  
Climbing the rungs  
Of my bone trellis known  
Intimate now withering  
Or simply gone under  
-Ground dormant

You’ll sprout  
Some fine day  
In my hands’ cracks  
Or so I hope, watching  
The dead garden  
All winter long  
Waiting
