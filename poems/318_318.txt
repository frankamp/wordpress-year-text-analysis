Blessing (Tools)

How badly did Christ cut his hands?  
How true the square of his first chairs?  
Joseph's worn tools-hammer, tongs,  
saw and plane-graceless extensions  
of his body. Heavy expectation hewed  
to wisdom of haggard scars, give of wood,  
loss of not a little blood. The world's sharp  
reminders smoothed. The begotten tools taken  
to hand in time, curves and unseen angles  
known by feel, unthought as breathing, bodily  
as wine and bread.
