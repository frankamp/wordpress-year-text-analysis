stone

no matter how life-like  
the stone feels  
how warm how heavy  
with blood how much  
like a wolf-cub  
a man-cub no matter  
its shape  
how it writhes  
against you  
how you hold it  
no matter what might  
be what potential you find  
in its cold eyes no matter  
how much you've come to love  
it is still a stone you carry  
it will always be a stone
