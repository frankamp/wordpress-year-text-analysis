Stood Up

I've kept my side of the bargain.  
Made tea, turned off the radio, settled in  
to sit quietly on the couch. Waiting  
for her to bring words of wisdom or tragedy,  
some stirring retort to recent evils  
or comfort in light of silence.  
What flame might she light, I wonder.  
I wait patiently for half an hour, more.  
I try to breathe calmly, like an ocean,  
and not tap my pen to my worried lip.  
Soon all I have is rain-sluiced sun  
and darkness pulled along by a slim thread  
of geese wailing their way home.  
I finish my tea and  begin to think  
of making dinner for one. Perhaps  
she'll show tomorrow.
