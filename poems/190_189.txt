Mapping

The continent long mapped & circled

in the fine line black of knowing.

Altitudes. Forests. Barren wastes

full of many hidden eyes.

Each rock lifted, turned, named

set back as a bone in its body.

Salt and beetle, pungent

loam, soft green papayas

fading toward rot.

Bird nests. Elk wallows. Mangrove swamps.

The shifting sand and skin of I,

crashing waves & cool winds,

the plate tectonics of I.
