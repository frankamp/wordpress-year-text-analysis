Nineveh

Twisted root.  
Blemished dove.  
Spotted ram of Jacob. I  
may pluck out my right eye.  
Even now the right hands bears  
aloft the sword to lop away  
the withered left.

Yet I may still cross the Jordan,  
circle seven times the walls  
of my life, waiting on the ramâ€™s horn.  
I might yet find my way to Nineveh,  
may feel the burning coal against my lips.

I may yet shake the dust.
