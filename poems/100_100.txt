Ebenezer

Christ the man says aloud  
the places he'll leave behind:  
Kings Hill, Goose Hollow,  
Buckman, Old Town, Irvington,  
Skidmore. A list made map  
incarnate. Each name  
distinct, each name  
an Ebenezer carved  
from the heart's quarry,  
his body ringing  
with the work of shearing  
and shaping. Each name  
a weight that keeps him  
close to earth and water  
a little longer.
