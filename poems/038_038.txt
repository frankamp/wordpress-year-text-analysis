Crocus

late night snow fall  
found mid-morning  
frozen in the side yard  
dusted over

broken nose an odd crocus  
sharp-angled hips  
and fingers crook'd  
in farewell

our bodies are mostly water  
frozen crystalline weavings  
sliced cross-wise snowflakes  
each unique

silent spinning refracting  
light glittering in slow descent  
to earth under hill at rest  
in the side yard
