A Little Extra Amber

Stay for a bit of conversation, won't you, sit down,  
stretch your legs, let rush hour traffic ease up. You're young,  
you've got time! Pour yourself a Scotch and top mine off  
while you're at it. Not too much now! Since you're here,  
I have a bird feeder needs hanging. The light's lovely  
isn't it? I just love late summer, August burning down  
at both ends. Damn if this poor boy isn't a mess tonight,  
hurling grapefruit, pure trash, I swear. Walked six batters  
in four innings, I don't know why they keep him. Lord  
we need a win. How's your wife? Still pretty as ever?  
Good good. That was me once, years ago. Oh stop  
you're a damned liar, but I can't curse you  
for trying. Dribble a little in there, honey. That'saboy.  
No, the knees are connected to the hipbone  
to the low back and the eyesight and p'etty soon  
it's all shot. But I'm still kicking, honey, still hoot-tootin'  
around. How's that brother of yours? He call you?  
Never calls me. That's alright, he's busy. They're all busy.  
Your uncles're spread so wide, I've got a boy in every port.  
Hoo! Not bad for an 80-year-old lady. Not bad. Look at that  
light, like the LORD might just come back today, could be.  
One of these days, soon. I can feel it. You get to be my age  
it comes like a bum knee tingling with the rain: the LORD  
has plans, He touches the top of your head when you're not looking, boy,  
just to remind you: _heads up, buster. Remember who's in charge._  
Ha. I remember-plentya things I can't find in this old basket of mine,  
but that one I know. Who's in charge? Not this old bird. Not anymore.  
Oh, there I go again. You're too sweet. Thank you, honey, thank you.  
Are you? I see, I see. Well, top me off before you go,  
a little extra amber never hurt a soul. Amiright?  
Love you too. Love all of you too damn much.
