Blessing (Odd Bod)

the body's odd manners: fits  
and starts palsied shake and hammer  
all knees and back-bent nelbows  
on pointe stiffened liquid lines  
scrangling around on hands  
and feet an upright ship upended  
where's the anchor anymore? ask  
the ghost in the machine making  
each eye blink independent circle  
lips into kiss the cheekbone forehead  
circled lips of the other bow-bent  
body ghost making it do what it wants  
rampant at the tiller running against the wind  
what it ought or ought not to do  
how did the ghost get in there  
anyway how will the ghost get out?
