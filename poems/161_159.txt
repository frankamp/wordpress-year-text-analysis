Subdue

I am the reason for concern  
in the wild. Alert yourselves  
to my stumbling destruction.  
There's no reason other  
than I am. Call and responsecousin kin keep alive  
away the hand of man  
inglorious insensitive  
to fern's slender growth  
fir's need to wait.  
Trod heavy-footed down  
bark and dirt, cave  
in molehills, idle  
and crush the last wild flower.  
Threaten the idyll by idling.  
Larch call is grief,  
river cries against its stones  
to the sea.
