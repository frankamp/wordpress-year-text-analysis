Funeral for the Father of the Bride

Flip the bouquets, swap the black ribbon  
for white lace, gin up the organ some,  
loosen your tie a little and holler  
new hymns to the choir. Rose petals'll smile  
just as well as wilt.  
The minister's worth his salt: tragedy shimmers  
into joy in the blink of an eye. _Do you? Do you?_  
Stand and clap at the kiss-the old man won't roll,  
from his vantage he knows the tears do double-duty.  
Afterwards, out on the green lawn, toast him under  
and the new couple to a long and happy life,  
God-willing. Shake the warm hands around you,  
swap stories of the young and the dead. Wear a tread  
in the dance floor, savoring your brief moment  
with the shinning bride. Drink deep of the wine,  
see them off at last light in a shower of rice and light.  
On the long walk back, hum a funeral dirge in the dark,  
at home in your one good suit.
