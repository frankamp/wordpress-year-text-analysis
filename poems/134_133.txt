Touch 'Em All

It's funny how far some premium NW lager will get you.  
Not to first base, if you're a little league team  
that can't drive in a run to save their lives,  
but sit long enough on the front porch, under sun  
and the shade trees, and as you watch the ball  
glide around the diamond-5-3-1-you'll begin to dream  
of what lurks out there, hidden in the hearts of men.

Of what might be, the possibilities  
of some walk-off home run  
or inside-the-park grand slam breaking  
every record and making them new in a single crack.  
The fear of the bat comes hard after  
all the loose chaw in this simple dugout  
on a quiet street across from this quiet game  
where nothing much's happened in seven innings.

And won't. But could. But could  
erupt at any second into runs and close calls  
and pickles dodged and scored on.  
You never know when glory comes in a cloud  
of dirt and cleats. So we drink and dream and chew  
the fat off our tongues all night until it's dark  
and the teams gone home, the diamond empty  
under a lonely streetlight, the perfect time  
to sneak on over, unseen by prying eyes,  
and run the bases, touch 'em all, one more time.
