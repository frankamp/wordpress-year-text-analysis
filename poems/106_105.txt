Pinot

Christ the man wanders  
the wine aisle, lingering  
amidst pinots' dark  
tannins and depth  
of dusky grapes, crushed.  
Just a small dinner  
among friends. He waves off  
the steward's suggestion  
of bargain bottles.  
He'll gladly pay. Yet  
finds he doesn't  
want to choose.  
The hour grows late.  
The party has begun.  
The loaf, fresh  
in his hand, still warm,  
is slowly going cold.
