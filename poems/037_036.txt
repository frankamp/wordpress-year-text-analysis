Polluting the Data Pool

What's about to happen?  
I fill out a very specific version of me-  
known name(s), address, DOB, SSN-  
hit send and wait a few months for  
what, exactly? A file full of intrigue  
and odd cross-checked connections  
I'd never in a million years put together  
as worthy of inquiry? Or just a one-pager  
detailing my FOIA filing? Is that vain?  
I _say_ there's no reason for the FBI  
or CIA or anyone else (except  
Target, Amazon, Apple and the like)  
to keep track of me-but I don't mean it,  
really. I _want_ to matter, flatter my ego  
a little. I marched in a protest, once!  
I've signed a petition or two in my time!  
Maybe I look like some sort of interloper;  
but just enough to be of interest,  
not so much to cause arrest. It's a fine line  
to demand of my government. Take notice  
but not too close. Who knows. Maybe  
strange cars will linger outside my house,  
men in trench coats will visit my friends  
and the other end of my phone line  
will now hold odd "empty" echoes and clicks.  
Or maybe in a few months, when I've forgotten  
the whole episode, I'll receive a plain folder  
under my door, empty but for this poem.
