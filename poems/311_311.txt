Blessing (Breathe)

breathe sound of being  
barely breeze breath  
sea-sound wash of grass  
running smooth stones  
to glass transparence  
flock of jellies flutter lungs  
of light filled to aching  
our own bones ribbed  
in chests breath hung  
in finite caves  
of dust infinity slips  
over bobbing heads  
crash swirling foam  
left on lips salty  
kiss stings bright
