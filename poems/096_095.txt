Christ the man vegges out  
with _A Streetcar Named Desire_,  
a half-rack and a pint of Cherry Garcia  
because sometimes a man needs  
to kick off his shoes, curl up  
under an old wool blanket  
and let go the angry man  
at the Plaid Pantry ranting  
about gov't healthcare,  
sidestep the gutterpunks  
asking for money to feed  
their menagerie, say thanks  
but no thanks to the woman  
with the bright and twitchy smile  
canvassing for a worthy cause.  
Sometimes a man just needs  
to let it be. Also: Brando.  
So he locks the door,  
cracks a cold one,  
and for just one night  
lets the great world spin.
