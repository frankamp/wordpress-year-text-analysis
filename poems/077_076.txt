Burden

Christ the man sets down  
his many keys on the table.  
The lights stay off. It's this  
he wants. Quiet. A breath  
of nothing. After a long day  
in the world he is bodily  
part of, his shoulders ache  
with the act of staying upright.  
His mind a catacomb he's lost in.  
But now crickets. Now the cat  
gently brushing his leg. The holy  
silence made of wind moving tree's  
budding branches. The hum  
of his heart winds down,  
finding its own right rhythm,  
remembering again what it is  
to come and go in prayer.
