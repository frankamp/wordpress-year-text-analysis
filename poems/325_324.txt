Blessing (Eating At the Table of Small Graces)

Joshua's eggs left by, his cup. He's off  
to be a father soon. I eat up the yellow  
that's left, clean the plate and fork,  
rinse the cup. The kitchen is slabs  
of light. I touch the bloody feet of Christ  
nailed over the door, zip my heavy coat.  
Every breath is colder. Weather has turned  
around a wooden post, like wire, barbed  
and full of metal. The garden hose sleeps  
in a pile on the porch. Three boys and a girl  
walk by, a lurching animal, hunting what  
I can't see. This will all freeze. Tonight  
the pipes will burst at the Baptist church.  
We'll wake to everything we've known  
encased, cut at odd angles, throwing light  
like stones. A frozen lake in the street.  
Tracks in the weeds. A robin on the doorstep.  
Power lines creak in glittering cases.  
The hens all gathered in. The world waiting  
for the right moment to shatter and groan.
