Blessing (Vespers)

When I look up at last  
from the day's bent work  
the sun is a smear  
of red, one last scrape  
hung over the canyon.

The world contracts  
to its essential edges.

I pause mid-stride  
to breathe the juniper  
and coming cold snap.  
The river runs clear  
at the bottom, singing vespers  
over the frozen stones.
