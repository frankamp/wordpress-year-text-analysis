Blessing (Work)

Man I can’t help  
But think of Adam  
That third morning  
East of the Garden.  
Up with the sun  
To another uncertain  
Day of labor, the same  
As yesterday. Welcome  
To the world. Shit.

So thank the LORD  
For a day of rest  
To wash my mouth  
Of cursing my blind eyes  
Dusty with the world  
Dig out the hard dirt  
Under fingernails  
& breathe.

How God knew  
What man needed  
(Not being man): mystery  
Yet it is right & good  
To pause & worship  
In whatever way  
Seems best. So I’ll stop  
Take bread & wine

& sing myself to sleep  
Tonight giving thanks  
For a body that works  
A head full of thick dreams  
& the hope of waking  
Another day to a life  
Worth rising to.
