Work Day Haiku

sad haiku reader  
always counting syllables  
words clunk like staplers

*

boring staff meeting  
I name every freckle on her neck  
Jolene is one of the Dakotas

*

such relief:  
odd trays in the fridge  
for takeout, not breast milk

*

three-thirty slump  
fun-size KitKat found in top drawer  
data entry is the best!

*

across the bar  
a woman w/a nicotine patch  
new tattoo or cancer

*

heading home late  
empty river flows pensive  
bulleted by rain

*

unfinished art  
breathing on the screen  
publish anyway
