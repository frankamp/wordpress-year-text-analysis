Asea

Christ the man gives up  
everything he holds  
into the plastic bowl.  
Sudden boundary  
of his new world.  
He learns the intimate  
smell of himself.  
All night long he rides  
nausea as a sailor,  
breathing deep  
through the valleys,  
but the sudden twist within  
will not be quelled.  
No calm sea, no sleep.  
On the raft of sheets  
the world goes by. Sidewalk  
voices, music from next door  
filter from another world.  
One's will he begins  
to understand isn't always  
what is done. The body taken  
from the mind: acrid taste  
of what's to come.
