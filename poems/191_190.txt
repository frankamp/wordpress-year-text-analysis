We named the _dog_ Indiana

It's a song that creeps up  
when I'm alone in the jungle  
wedged onto a crowded bus  
each and anytime I bury my fists  
in my pockets like a lost treasure  
the pump house of my heart  
slam-banging around the Octagon  
humming a brass-backed melody to kill  
the lurking savage bears or bees  
or bears with bees in their mouths  
A song to shout down demons on the bus  
and put a smile all the way to the back  
of your face whip your head around  
dodge every poisoned arrow  
and return the shrunken golden idol  
to the altar from which it was plundered
