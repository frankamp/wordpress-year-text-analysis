Animosity

such a strange  
fitting slicker

seal skin skinned  
stretched oily tight

it wears hot and close  
to the skin

don't breathe  
repelling everyday rain

hung in the hall  
with the other coats

takes shape  
a pup wailing

in the dark  
see it?

wrist-deep  
in dishwater

each fork  
a sharp rebuke

each saucer  
a potential shard

in blunt  
hands
