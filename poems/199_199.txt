Reading Jack Gilbert in the Woods

We buy wood to burn  
in the wilderness: bringing home the dead.  
The fire goes all night  
by a stream that refuses to settle its name.  
The flames die at last  
for all has been fed to it-everything consumed.  
We will carry the burnt husks  
that remain out in a light rain, under mist.  
We leave the ashes we've made  
in the woods, blackened stones ringing what's left.
