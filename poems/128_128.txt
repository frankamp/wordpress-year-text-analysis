Sanctuary

Our chosen tree dead  
blown open in mid  
-winter.

Desperation.

A wearied she-wolf  
caught out wild  
of eye  
stiffens in our drift.

We come to her  
dying body

crawl her hundred passages  
comb her  
from the inside.Â Preserved

in wax our heat  
mingles with hers.

Our kingdom come.

In the spring  
the farmers find her

glowing golden

from the inside. Alive

with our hum.
