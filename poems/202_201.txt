Gardening

the apples sing their falling song  
all night on our roof. it wakes the cat  
and us from dreams of fortresses  
and wine. we press together  
hooked at the knees and hips.  
in the morning bending at the waist  
to pluck and pluck again the sweet rot  
of browning fruit found on the ground  
we sing the song God gave  
in the garden to all creation.

we fill a barrel and flies follow  
in the heat of afternoon. here it is  
all at once: the full height of life  
left to fall and seep and end  
and in the very instant feed  
the tail of its telling to the mouth  
open and waiting. we are the apples  
and the falling. we are the song  
sung since the root of the garden  
was laid, since before there were roots  
or gardens.
