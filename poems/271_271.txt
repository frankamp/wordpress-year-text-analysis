Terza Rima

Years later Boccaccio  
would christen it  
_divina_, elevating it  
into something greater  
than it had been

to Dante  
it was just _la commedia  
_his broken life  
woken in the middle  
of a dark wood  
in Tuscany, hunting  
the next step

finding solace  
in the form  
and freedom  
of rhyme, choosing  
a descent into Hell  
in hopes  
of climbing out again
