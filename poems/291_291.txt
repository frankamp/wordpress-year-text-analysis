Poseidon

Man, the man you are  
appears as out of sea fog  
when you shave down  
the burly anemone  
of a fuck-off beard you wear  
around like a threat.  
When did you claim  
the tarnished crown?

Washed up on shore  
among the sleeping  
battleships you wandered,  
glinting hard.  A sound  
fathoms deeper than  
the growling tide saying  
_take what was always yours. _

Mermaid kiss. Bullion.  
Salt sting. Trident.  
Your own face  
hovering covered  
in old wire, creeping  
rust, barnacles  
and seaweed.  
Come clean.  
Be thee.
