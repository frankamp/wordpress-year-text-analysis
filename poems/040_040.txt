ice storm

the music fades  
each note a strain  
silence is the song

at rest a bellied  
soundlessness empty  
gong of how we hear

so muted our ears  
attune anew learn  
a different listen

day is long  
and night is long

of a sudden crack  
sharp edges edging  
where void ran on

crash and shatter  
folded rills soft  
break geometric

violence thaws  
the song resumes  
inside the world
