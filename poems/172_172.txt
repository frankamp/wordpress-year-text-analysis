Sisyphus

I roll a stone uphill  
all night forever  
tumbling inside you

sound of seashells  
self-flagellating  
in the dryer

arms ache from keeping  
this position  
bent-arm Atlas

one cold ear turned  
always to the stone  
& its quiet voice

when my foot slips  
casting down  
the stone rolls

& breaks  
& breaks  
into shards

I walk the mound down  
find another stone  
to bring again

tumbling  
in my aching arms  
all night long
