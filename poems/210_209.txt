Tabernacle

If the body's a temple  
I'm a trapaulin tent  
animal skin stretched over bone  
braces, made for travel  
and quick packing  
at the sight of trouble  
or the descending Whirlwind.

Ages of dust and incense can't scrub  
the blood clean. Smell of hair  
and the last moments of slaughter  
before being raised up  
to new life. The cross-beams  
fail; the hide panels wear out.

Carted around the desert  
at the mercy of hands  
that don't understand their own  
function. Left out to be filled  
with the punishing wind  
that clenases

and fills a moment whole  
then gone, deflated, empty  
of anything but the space held  
a space of nothing waiting  
for the next roiling storm  
to roll across the desert
