Blessing (Doubt)

Take this hand to your lips  
kiss-whistle across its emptiness  
Your own song of want  
and sorrow your tongue touching  
the haggard edge of All that is  
Real salted iron blood  
taste it and know that I Am

Peer out the ragged eye  
A thousand camels pass through  
Linger the long knowing  
of your touch, each finger held  
in the absence test the depth of All  
you've never and always known
