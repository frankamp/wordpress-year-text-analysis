Wings

I bump into Pete and lean awhile.  
The cafe's nearly closed. The kids eat  
their wings, licking sticky fingers.  
Cannibal grins. Clouds are coming  
off the Cascades. Pete flexes gently,  
says his fingers tingle with the pressure  
change and every time he passes  
the equipment shed. The machine  
still whines when he powers it on,  
jawing for the rest of him. We've all lost  
something out here we're trying to reattach:  
the better part of years, family land, houses  
and the things inside, knowing  
just when our bodies will give and break.  
Each hard-packed grave is a home we've built.  
The kids are restless. We shake  
gentle and shuffle off, me  
to my corner to watch the storm spread.  
The wings, extra hot, make me tear. I suck  
each bone clean of meat and grease,  
a charnel pile on the empty plate.  
The celery sticks out, bright green  
challenger as the wind and dust descend.
