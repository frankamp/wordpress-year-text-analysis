Supper

Christ the man  
keeps it simple:  
snap peas from the vine,  
green onions, back-porch mint  
torn by the rough handful.  
Tossed with a little oil,  
dash of salt. A glass of wine.  
His knife sings  
its thanks to the fork  
over the ready plate  
rimmed in gold. Oil  
graces his beard  
glinting in the sun.
