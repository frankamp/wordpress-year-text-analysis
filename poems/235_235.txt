Steelhead Falls

So many fine-boned bodies  
lined up, ready  
to hurl themselves into the silver  
cascade crashing blue-green

I thought of the trout  
of your slim body, perfect  
pearl eye, rainbow slick-scaled  
and shining

That was years ago  
when we knew the lingo  
of the cove, secret society  
lingering on the edge, leaping

We have lept

We know the jagged shoals  
dark pull of the current  
we fight in our own ways  
together, sheltered behind the rock
