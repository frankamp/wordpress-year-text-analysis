Phone

Christ the man calls  
his brother on the phone  
every weekend.  
Like clock work:  
an hour, to the minute,  
every Sunday.  
It's mostly silence  
and heavy breathing.  
What the other  
does, what the other  
might have been  
goes unsaid. Grief  
is the electric hollow  
of an open line.  
Every hour ends  
the same: time up,  
right hands spread wide,  
fingers and palms matched  
in width and color,  
pressed to thick glass  
that says all they  
never will. Led away  
without the other,  
alone again. But not  
alone. Not ever.
