Path

Words like _Christ_ are broken  
reeds wind blows upon whistling  
wind against me. Where is my friend  
I hold in grief? Who shores me up  
in joy? I'm about done turned out  
at the end of this long year  
needing more than myths and men  
of standing. Need none of them.  
Need  God to get down  
in my shoes, shove his bloodied feet  
in, tread the miles. Words are little  
help along this path; walk  
a ways and see what comes  
of steady movement, faith  
in one unsteady foot  
in front of the other.
