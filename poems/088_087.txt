Men

Christ the man centered  
among men. At table,  
at work, at play.  
Sanded skin conducts  
crisp current. So many minds  
he longs to pick the lock of.  
Settles for the press of chest  
to chest, slow breath, the deep  
well of eye to eye in a man  
well met or wounded. He centers  
himself among men  
to find how it is to lose  
himself, to be found.
