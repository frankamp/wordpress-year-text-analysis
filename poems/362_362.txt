Blessing (Honeycomb)

I am weary  
of these poems  
carved of bitterness  
and loss, spun  
from finely turned  
doubts.

I long for bees  
and heron’s blue  
shadow overhead,

for the fox grinning  
his tail into his hole  
just ahead of the hound,  
who is happy  
to be hunting, alive  
in his body.

Where is the raucous yellow?  
Where the whale’s song sounding  
so like the seas of the heart?

The poems I crave  
bloom like morels, hidden  
in the feet of things,  
covered in rain and rot,  
not apart from, but one with.

Honeycomb sweetens  
in the presence  
of the sting.
