Diamonds

Daughters dig the dirt  
for blessings hidden  
for you alone

tucked up under green grass  
and daffodils, the shining gloss of pavement  
and caves deck-eaves make.

Hunt worms and beetles.  
Turn every rock. The dirt under your nails  
is gleaming glorious.

Bluebird cheers you on  
from the apple tree you climb  
to get a better vantage.

Ignore the undermining shouts of men  
to climb down, clean up,  
quit digging. Keep digging

diamonds hidden  
where men can't see.  
Keep to the task

until the mine you rise from  
is your own, dug wholly  
by your hands

wiser now and worn  
digging diamonds  
only you could find.
