Failure

in this particular case  
just means incomplete

like an unfinished bridge  
spanning towards its sister-self

across a river: you know  
what should be

but isnâ€™t quite.  
A poem

at rest  
in an untidy pile

with the thousand other  
malformed malcontents

though slightly closer  
to the cabinet door

than the others  
where it can feel a breeze

and see a just bit  
of the world passing by.
