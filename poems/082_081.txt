Altar

Christ the man spreads  
an old blanket and lays out  
a million hurts, a curiosity cabinet  
of woe. No entry fee to see  
what he's carried just this day.  
He wanders the oddly attired rows,  
caressing each item in turn: a lamp  
battered in, a broken bell, shattered pieces  
of someone's wedding china. Section 8 vouchers  
banded together. Losing lotto tickets,  
bounced checks, report cards, pink slips.  
A hundred thousand notes that find their way  
into his pocket, cribbed on takeout menus  
and medical bills, faded receipts and obits.  
Crumpled prayers. No one stops to buy  
or even look. No one ever does. Night drops.  
The items blur, become indistinct. Piled,  
he douses the day's take in lighter fluid  
and touches off a match. The acrid smoke  
stains him, blots out stars. He adds  
sandalwood and myrrh, frankincense  
for a sweet char. His incense rises  
and spreads on the four winds. Soon  
the others will come to offer their own  
fuel, broken bits suited to the maw.  
Each leaves lighter and just as smudged  
as he.
