The neighborhood’s alight tonight  
with Bird’s singing: shout gerbil  
gerbil! from the backyard.  
Down the way the corgis  
lose their minds. He’s just playing, girls.  
Bird’s got ribbons on his legs  
that fly when he runs, little flags  
like he’s a country making  
and remaking borders.  
If you see him in line at the store  
he stands stiff, eyes pinched shut  
with the help of his fingers  
and rocks, recites numbers.  
Don’t stare. Smile and pass  
right on by. He’ll feel you.  
He’s a pirate-dinosaur.  
Just the other day I found him  
on the bridge at the creek  
peering at himself peering  
at himself. Like he was reading  
water or the mind  
of the giant pond Koi  
that’s just an orange road cone.  
He falls into a pit that is him  
but can’t know the edges of.  
Bangarang! Bangarang, Bird.  
If you cup your hands  
to your ear you’ll catch more  
of what he’s got to give.
