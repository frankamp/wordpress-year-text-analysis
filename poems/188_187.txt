Burial

We are too far south for ice floes.

We've killed all the natives with our kindness.

I set the totem of my troubles

(all in pearl) on the burial skiff.

Wreathed with weeds

yellow eyes of daffodil

blinking flame.

Early moon nests in the pines.

The sea is high

we shove her off

to bob until the waves come

scuttle her to the bottom

covered in seaweed

worshiped by what lurks there.
