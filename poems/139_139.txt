Solidarity

I took a cue  
from the cat  
and the beer I drank  
in the sun  
in the chair  
I shared with said cat  
and settled down  
to doze, head in hand.  
But  
my body rebelled  
at each subtle dip  
to viscerally kick me  
AWAKE!  
I've read that pulse  
is my body's last  
ditch effort  
to keep me alive  
for my body thinks  
of sleep as death.  
I like that  
my body watches  
out for me,  
thinking existential  
thoughts, even when  
I'm not. Needless  
to say I didn't nap,  
and in solidarity  
nudged the cat  
out of my lap  
so we could see  
what we'd been missing.
