Erin/Aaron

there's a little birdhouse in her soul  
he built himself.

when one speaks bright  
feathers flutter out.

what kissing face she makes  
at himself in the mirror breaks

her heart a little each time  
he does it.

she laughs loud and scares him  
like he likes. he gentles her

when she becomes  
a bear. they share fierce

hands and eyes that shine  
in the rain.

twinned simple. complex.  
simplex.

he dances her as if  
neither was leading

with an intuition born  
before knowing.

her shadow is the one  
he has always known.

he is to her  
-self. same.
