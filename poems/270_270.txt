Baggage Claim

A humbling thought sneaks in  
under the haze of jet lag, lumped in  
with the oddly personal luggage  
just off American Airlines 2211  
with service from DFW  
buckling along the shifting silver  
plate tectonics of baggage carousel #9:  
the world we leave and return to so easily  
doesn’t need us, doesn’t even think  
of us–it just keeps running along  
like we weren’t there when in fact  
we were all along somewhere, though _where_ is  
the fixed nut of a problem we spin around.  
What is _gone_? Or _here_? Such tesseraction  
is too much after canned air and the swollen skin  
of half-sleep, packed with other people’s dreams.  
The travel-addled brain is fit only to watch  
the bags’ slow spin, waiting to collect mine  
when it's finally disgorged, carry it to the curb,  
raise a hand to hail a taxi and head for home.
