Weekenders

Seems to be quitting time in Pacific City.

The bartender at the Pelican  
not-so-subtly relays its his last day,  
as of, like, right then,  
pours it extra stiff _on the house.  
I've got dreams, _he says. We can see  
them fading with the tide.

Down the bar two old boys gripe  
and groan, bitch about their boss  
and wives, the shitty pay and shittier  
tourists, the never-ending wet and  
ever-shifting ground. They swear  
they'll leave down to Florida, then laugh  
_Fuck it!_ and motion for another round.

At Chester's Grocery Mitch absently bags  
our bare necessities-chocolate, Graham crackers,  
a bag of marshmallows we'll find ossified  
in a cupboard, more rum-  
paging in a deadpan voice for _Brenda_  
_to checkout, Brenda to checkout._

Brenda who never shows, who's clearly not  
just on break, who may have quit  
just now or years ago. Brenda who for all we know's  
dead and buried. Mitch's itchy ring finger  
on the intercom again. We take our things and go.

We've quit our city in a mad-house rush  
to be here, on this fragile spit of sand  
that keeps them from the sea.  
Flip-flops, sunscreen we won't wear,  
beach towels, a trashy novel or two.  
Our particular cares  
forgotten, we consider theirs

a kind of treat. Respite in out of the lee  
of our own looming dune. Someone else's  
will do nicely. We toast them each by name  
from our rented room, spilling a little rum  
and Coke into the sand, an offering of peace  
and tranquility, if only for a night or two.
