Water

We boil down to so little:  
salt, trace elements  
calcified in the soil.  
Dust to dust.

Rehydrate  
to animate.

We are more  
than crystalline.

We live as skinned  
sponges. Wrung out  
we pale; bloated  
we sop.

We require current  
to remain

lest we wither  
like a creek gone gluch.

Hips and elbows,  
sharp teeth, sharp tongues  
tent the sail  
of the body.

Fear coats the mouth  
in dust.

Water water everywhere  
but nary a drop.

The sustaining wave  
washed out: acres of sand,  
white shells glittering,  
our own glossy reflection

a pillar  
of salt.
