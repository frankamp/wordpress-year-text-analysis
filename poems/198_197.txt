If I Die First

Bury me beneath the marriage oak.

Then dig me up

and prop me on the couch

to keep you company.

I'll scare away the beasties

and let you sleep well at night.

Even a tin of ash I make

the tomatoes grow six feet tall

and giant. Taste me in the summer;

can me, the vine-ripened sweetness lingers

long into the fall.
