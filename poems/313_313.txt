Blessing (Tile)

Man’s mind made  
to make right  
angles cut & angle & curse  
awkward eighths  
& at length eke out  
a thin-shimmed grace  
of a tough corner  
no paint there  
only hard edged porcelain  
and porcelain’s sharp echo  
the wet-saw shirrs  
a song of fingers taken  
and the fine fleck of dust  
as white as bone motes  
in the eye no beauty  
here, no trick: just stark  
tile, pale as the body  
washed, free of dust  
sluicing the day’s  
darker self, down  
and gone, away
