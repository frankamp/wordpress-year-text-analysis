Fence

The something in us that doesn't love  
a wall wonders aloud

how a whole state nearly became  
a lonely stretch of country road

at night in Wyoming.  
We shrug and turn back to our work

auguring the last holes,  
setting the posts.

Someone says "Elves!" and the laugh  
that comes is the sound

of barbed wire shivering  
in its shining coil.

Staples gouge gnarled posts  
precise.

With the last of our strength,  
all our muscle, we tension the wire

pulling tighter, tight.
