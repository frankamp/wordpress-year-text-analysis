Pass Through the Eye

Cut the camel up, fool.

Strip off the hide,  
stuff it in the hollow hump.  
Pass the gory mess hand over  
hand through the Eye.

Not easy, no. Never said  
easy. Never said impossible.

Cut off the ears of the rich man,  
string them as coins on a cord  
hung about the neck of the poor  
man crawling through the Eye.

Hear the golden hallelujahs  
on the other side. Crawl after.
