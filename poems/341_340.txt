Harbor (This Morning)

where ships come  
to find respite

but never stay;  
not why ships are made

what course, what chart  
will you make today?

what harbor leave  
and new one find?

among the monsters  
of the keening deep

what flag flies  
from your top-mast:

black bandit  
or burning love?

call to them  
see which rise.
