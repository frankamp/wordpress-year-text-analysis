Sportsing

I am thrilled by sudden violence,  
evasive maneuvers and the threat of a win.  
I am strongly encouraged to eat pistachios  
and Coca-Cola, preferably in Detroit.  
My grandma is a funny-ass lady  
after three scotch and waters.  
Bruno Mars is a neo-Michael Jackson  
with moves to match. Anthony Kedis  
cannot pull off a partial 'stache.  
Philip Seymour Hoffman died  
and Bob Dylan, the Muppets  
and Bruce Willis want me to buy a car.  
Bread and circuses require shiny trophies  
filled with Bud Light. Pete Carrol had a good day.  
Peyton Manning is wearing his sad-pants.  
Corn chips and guac are the best  
way to ruin an evening. On the couch  
with my best friend watching a game  
we don't care once a year isn't so bad.  
Heartburn lingers.
