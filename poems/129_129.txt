Reconstruction

She took off her breasts  
like taking off a coat

of armor, forged  
for a battle

she never wanted.  
Or a sweater

she'd had forever, comforting  
but worn

just because. She desires  
something more

true to come  
to pass.

In truth  
they were severed

not simply  
shucked,

jettisoned  
these curves

of the double _s_,  
given up,

though not entire:  
snaking curl

of scars remain  
reminding

who he is.
