Contigo

the lid of my Chinese-made travel mug  
speaks in Spanish, stamped  
with the language of love

I am bleary eyed, early waking  
to green Douglas fir  
& bird sentries watching over me

the Sandy River hauling its net  
of sound about my feet  
& ears, lulling

_con tigo con tigo_  
it's the dream I had twisting  
the silk of my sleeping

bag around anxious legs, knees  
the emptiness where yours are  
not

this watered-down coffee is longing  
I drink, filling up but never  
quite enough
