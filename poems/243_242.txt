Fish Creek Mtn.

Two abreast  
in one wet tent  
miles to go in the morning  
without ever knowing  
what loon lives  
on this lake.

We hurl ourselves  
into the created world  
to contend with it  
as men and women made  
of dust. Again and again

We are defeated  
in the same instant  
we are glorified.  
A shroud of mist  
on the lake. Rainsong  
trickling down

Sound reminder  
of what we are  
of what we are not.  
Kneel at the altar of fire,  
baptized in its smoke.
