the dry time

leave the city before  
rain comes

split the juniper wide open  
to chew its spiced meat

a rock on the tongue cuts  
thirst

smell the sage, alfalfa  
sweet grass burn

out west dark clouds nuzzle  
the mtn

cool wet wind  
itches

the dry time, sand in shoes  
and dusty maps

chapped kisses zinging  
like heat lightening

late nights out  
gin cracking cubes

cicada songs hums  
up under skin

over, turned  
like a stone

in soft dirt  
worms squiggling

among winter squash  
trumpeting their arrival

soon: cling of wool  
soon: fires moved indoors

soon: the harvest moon  
rolls around again

soon: peat smoke  
smoldering dark dreams

of whiskey plums  
fallen leaves piled

to rot of the crack  
of thunder

and open skies  
pouring out and out
