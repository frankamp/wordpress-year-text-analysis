Blessing

Christ the man counts  
each drawn breath  
a blessing. An _ER_  
rerun is on TV  
in the other half  
of the curtained room.  
The man lying there  
behind the veil  
won't lie there for long.  
His young charge sleeps on  
despite the ruckus.  
Blood cleanses itself,  
lungs take air, release,  
take air again. Peace.  
A woman yells, alarms sound,  
and for one hectic moment  
the two rooms mingle. Between  
worlds. Which is the real?  
Christ the man bows his head  
to count each breath, blessing.
