A Little Drunk

It's late. I'm a little drunk  
and spooling out  
a poem at the eleventh hour.  
Tomorrow's lark will come  
too early. The cat's keening  
I'll bat at absently. What rising  
will happen when we come to it.  
Now a brief unbuckling  
of words, a waking dream  
blurred a little longer.
