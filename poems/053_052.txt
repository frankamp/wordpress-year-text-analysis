without a word

we dig all day  
just the two of us  
without a word  
one shovel  
and its dull blade

we cut the grass  
in a long row  
lay it out  
gently  
as he was

foot by slow foot  
we disappear  
below ground  
making the path  
straight and narrow

robin's egg sky  
infinite blue rectangle  
you stand at the edge  
backlit head back  
drinking from an old canteen

I think for sure  
you mean to leave  
the shovel buried  
step down to me

catch the apple blossoms  
the trees toss  
down in mourning  
without a word
