Sunday

Cobwebbed brown bottle  
filled with a spray of paper  
flowers and the early light  
I'm struck by. The insistence  
of sin again and again. Dead.  
Alive. Dead. I can't untangle  
the inexorable down  
to its individual threads, finer  
than spider's silk, than a cat-hair  
shadow left in my lap.  
My mind distends, bells  
out beyond reason into the fog  
of faith where everything is creak  
and gray. I wait there  
until you come to settle  
at my side. None clearer  
but now, not alone.
