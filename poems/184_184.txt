Morning Barista

God bless you, morning barista,  
raking the twisted hymn  
of your loud southern scag  
across my still-asleep brains.

Praise be to your crass jokes,  
lamenting of love found and lost  
in one fell swoop, your armchair  
quarterbacking and hermeneutic  
detailing of box scores canted  
in your slow-mo Announcers Voice.

Hallelujah to your slack banter,  
political pilings on–annotated  
and forcefully fed to us,  
your accidental congregation–  
to your unceasing intercession  
in my scrambled prayers, lifting up  
searching eyes to the stucco heaven  
when, try as I might, I can’t.

I’m grateful for your service  
of suffering, blunting my need  
for silence and reflection.  
You gift me new reserve, steeled.  
My unmade son, tasting colic  
and new teeth, scrabbling  
with a penitent’s cry  
for a hundred comforts  
in the earliest hours, thanks you.

You make me a better man, morning barista,  
a little less me, a little more you.  
Praise be, amen.
