Acquaintance

I didn't see you  
leave the earth  
or your quick return  
to it.

I knew you only  
in the shouting seconds  
in which you thought  
your last. What did you think?

When I turned to see  
you, you wereÂ  gone. Fallen  
to shadow and foliage.  
Swallowed up.

We never met  
or maybe we did  
on the street  
in passing

as is common  
and so uneventful  
as not to matter  
or worth noticing.

I can't help  
but know you now  
or what you've left  
me holding.
