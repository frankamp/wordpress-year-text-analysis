Leaving Waukegan

God bless you Tom Waits  
driving I-5 through East LA  
gruffly telling the Muse  
to fuck off, come back  
when you're not stuck  
in rush hour traffic.

It's probably apocryphal,  
the kind of story ginned up  
at cocktail parties and campfires  
about a man wrestling an angel  
down in the dirt, demanding  
a name, limping the rest of his life  
for the effort.

Probably you just pulled over  
in the shoulder, flashing hazards,  
scrambling for a pencil nub  
and the back of your hand  
divinely inspired to scribe  
the melody of Jockey Full of Bourbon

like the rest of us, poor saps,  
who swallowed the lie  
that genius lives inside each one  
like some sleek-suited Grendel  
who'll make the best of us  
out our own blood.

Maybe that's why you sound how you do.  
Torn up inside, growling  
at the little god clawing its way out  
as you sing.
