Genuflection

it's a habit  
not that  
I call it that

I won't call it that  
if you ask

-don't-

say _issue_ _concern_  
_off-night_ _nerves_ never

_habit_: a thing incarnated  
in adoration

never _add  
_-iction too close

to the scripted  
lie wink    pious toss of the head

de-  
genuflect-  
ion

belly up unto the altar  
& taste

the proffered cup
