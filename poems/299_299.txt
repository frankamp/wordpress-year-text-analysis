Rail

A blued band of steel  
runs the wily wilded length  
of me, a flattened fist  
buried in dead leaves, amber  
bottles broken, sheafs of glossy women  
tossed aside. The haunts of lost men.  
No train runs this route, no howl  
at the midnight passing spooks  
the fox in his den. Just wind  
singing over steel, rustling clean  
the spare and glinting truth  
of a track lain long ago, forged, forgotten,  
true down to its tang. A rail, singular  
strength, a hum radiating up  
from earth, down from the heavens  
in a flash, in-set inception of bone  
burnished to high shine, rigid,  
righteous, free of dross. The rail  
no man sets inside the chest, sits  
ever-ready for the locomotive's  
second coming. Shake the dirt  
at its passing. Rustle up the fox  
as first witness to what has come  
to pass at the spine of things,  
new movement through the bracken  
in the broken land.
