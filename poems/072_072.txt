Tabernacle

Christ the man stalks  
the Jos. A Banks store  
at the mall, slipping in  
and out of the expensive  
and inexpensive suits  
on his lunch break.  
He's come to love  
the weight and glide  
of silk and nylon  
against his skin.  
Cool blue pin-stripes,  
the gray houndstooth  
of his eyes. The swish  
of fabric on the rack.  
A sabeled leather smell imbues  
the salesman's quiet canting,  
weaving a holy space.  
The appointed hour comes;  
he exits quiet as he came. Leaving  
the jacket void, formless  
without his shape to hold,  
hung again with care  
upon a wooden hanger.
