When Jesus Come

Sharp end of the stick I got  
rubbing in my eye tonight.  
It burns & bores a hole  
& there ain't much to be done.  
Sharp end of the stick I got  
rubbing in my old eye tonight  
but it's Glory Hallelujah  
when Jesus come.

Broken bit of a pot I got  
scraping my poor sores.  
Blood & ashes run down  
my arms, run a dirty river.  
Broken bit of of a pot I got  
scraping away at these sores  
but it's Glory Hallelujah  
when Jesus come.

Sackcloth on my back I got  
to cover up my nakedness.  
Itch & burn, rend & tear  
& dust upon my head.  
Sackcloth on my back I got  
to weep my falling tears  
but it's Glory Hallelujah  
when Jesus come.

When Jesus come on Judgement Day  
it's Glory Hallelujah.  
This broken body rolled aside,  
the tomb an empty hole,  
every tear wiped away in the blink of an eye  
for it's glory, glory Hallelu,  
when Jesus come on Judgement day.
