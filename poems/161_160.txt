Gratitude

His hands poke out of frayed Army cuffs  
and envelope mine.  
He says, if he wanted, he could  
snap my spine. _Snap_. Like that.  
He smiles and accepts my gift  
of leftover birthday cake,  
a corner piece smothered  
in frosting and the end  
of a woman's name.  
His deadly handshake reciprocity  
for sweetness. I wait in fear  
for the bus. His eyes lock  
far away. He asks again  
for the change  
I can't give him.
