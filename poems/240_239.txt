Vamoose

Christ had this nifty trick  
of slipping away just when  
he was about to have his head caved in  
or get himself hurled off a cliff  
by the local talent.

What luck. Or gift  
of the Spirit, I suppose, given  
he’s the giver and keeper  
of such things. Spirited away,  
isn’t that what we say  
to mean poof?

Vamoose! And so he did  
at the exact right  
and wrong moments,  
at least from where I'm standing.  
Held out when he shoulda folded.  
And good thing.

Not me, though. I mostly want the wind  
to make a ghost on the hilltop,  
slip off unnoticed, leave them  
looking around, wondering  
just where it was I went to. Taken,  
maybe, up into the clouds.
