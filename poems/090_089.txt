Cedar

Christ the man tastes  
cedar on the wind. Rain  
storms its way down valley  
swamping the low-lands.  
The crops he tilled last week  
may drown or survive.  
Far west an eagle turns  
a slow swath, ignoring  
the coming storm. Lord  
of the air claims his own.  
Lord of the air rides out  
what comes to shake him.  
He leans to on the porch,  
waiting. The first drops fall,  
the smell of cedar rises.
