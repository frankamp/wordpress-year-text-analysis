Land of Enchantment

Wine trips a switch,  
turns on the gene  
my grandfather begat  
my uncle and I  
before he died.  
Brain cancer.

Years later:  
he raging incoherent  
in the middle of the night;  
me a sad little mollusk  
on the phone, afraid  
he'll find us, smash  
down the door. Monster  
I never knew. I swore: never.

Now a tannic bloom a tumor  
at my chest, creeps  
up my neck. Keeps me  
company. Soft sway  
if I stand too quick crash  
to sleep & wake early  
without dreaming  
of monsters or men.

They're gone now. One  
to the Land of Enchantment,  
or Denver, San Francisco, Michigan,  
who knows; Grandpa buried  
with the horses. I drink  
to remember the blood  
I don't know, to forget  
the blood I am.
