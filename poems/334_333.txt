Blessing (Hands)

Then, winter comes on  
& you can’t make a fist.  
Your gearing mashed & torn,  
soldered to an eagle’s claw.  
All day long you are building  
a fire in your hands, rubbing  
constantly, feeling coming slowly,  
a communiqué from headquarters  
out to the war-ravaged front lines.  
_No reinforcements. No supplies.  
__No surrender._ You dig in, storing  
up, delegating as good generals do.  
When at last all is made good, you salute  
flat-handed & firm, tight to the brow.  
A gesture unequivocal. No surrender.
