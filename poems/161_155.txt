Not

It's the same as a trout  
leaping from the bathtub.  
The trout living in a room  
whose ceiling he is monarch under.  
A god of the fourth wall broken  
by the rainbow gleam of the trout  
who is a beautiful question  
arcing the white tiled space  
of the bathroom. A moment  
out of time. We start here  
with a trout, leaping.  
Where we go now  
is impossible.
