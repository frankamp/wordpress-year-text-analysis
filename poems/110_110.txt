Easter

Christ the man tingles  
in his skin again. The fit  
of fingers, weight of skin  
and bone, the song  
his blood sings. I am  
who I am, he says  
to the bolted door.  
The other side is grief  
and fear, a room full  
of emptied men. He holds  
out his hand in blessing.  
Lock and board give way,  
a veil parting. Unseen  
he returns, enters again  
the lives of others.  
In their midst as Christ,  
as man.
