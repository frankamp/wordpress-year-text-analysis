Big River

(after reading Huck Finn)

We say _it_ (nudge-nudge)  
so often James  
sets down his dog-eared  
spine-broken book

climbs up on the block  
his desk makes  
in protest.

His dangling dreadlocks  
sound manacles.

It suddenly smells of piss  
and chattel-mud, though  
outside this classroom  
the night is fine.

Stomachs turn bile and vinegar.  
Taste of shame.

White knuckles kiss  
sweaty palms.

Don’t we float the Big River together?  
Big wheel keep on turning.

That truck is trash.

That truck  
is a sow's ear. The truth?

Each wooden desk holds  
only one. This raft weren’t lashed  
to keep us all.

No matter.

Running aground,  
busting up  
each of us

water-logged cottonwoods  
pulled by a muddy current  
we can't none of us stop as

mighty Mississippi rolls on

to the Gulf, open mouth  
of salt and sorrow

sea's freedom  
seems preferable  
someway  
to swallowing truth.
