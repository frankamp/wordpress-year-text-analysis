At the NHS Induction Ceremony

It's sort of amazing to watch them  
skate across the expanse  
of this big black stage, just barely,  
in rumpled suits and heels  
and starter mustaches. They joke  
with each other, wave awkwardly  
to their parents, shake hands  
and accept their certificate,  
always on the verge  
of missing a step and falling  
into the shimmering shadow  
of themselves projected up  
from the dark. It's like they don't know  
it's there. It's like they are only aware  
of the bright shining light that they cast.  
Which will be the first to go out?  
Which will light a thousands suns?  
I clap when prompted, but absently,  
watching their parents and the smiles  
that hide the fear of the questions,  
applauding so forcefully their hands glow.
