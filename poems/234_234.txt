Tent

I built the tent in the dark  
put my breath into the ThermRest  
laid out your sleeping bag  
while you wept by the fire

I woke in the night, afraid  
you'd stumbled off without a light  
that you'd lose your way  
and fall alone

I reached out a hand  
into the empty space  
between us  
not for the last time
