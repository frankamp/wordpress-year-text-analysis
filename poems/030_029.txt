hit and run report

_And the victim,_  
_Max Martin,_  
_is described as remaining_

That's it. The page ends  
but does Max Martin,  
the victim? He remains

I'm told, but nothing more.  
Where? In what state?  
The rest is left vague.

I suppose I could simply turn  
the page and learn  
the plain truth

about recovery time,  
litigation, the injurious  
particulars,

and let  
that be that,  
but some hand

I can't fully grasp  
stays me,  
stirs me

to hazard wild  
guesses about  
the unknown

victim,  
Max Martin,  
and the state of

his remaining.  
Bound, now, somehow  
to my own.
