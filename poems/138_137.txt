Fargo

The neighbors  
are chipping  
their rhododendron hedge.

I can't help  
but think of the end  
to Fargo.

His lonely foot  
jiggling  
in the teeth.

Dull winter  
snow  
petaled red.

The house,  
the empty lake  
beyond.

Isn't that how it is?

Iced over  
by the odd  
memory flickering.

A scene  
forgotten for years  
returns.

I bend  
to tie my shoe  
and lose

myself  
in the shadow  
I make.
