Horizon

It's your dread pirate-self I see  
wilding beard plaited, tied up  
with a blue bow of China silk  
astern some sea-going vessel  
bearing your wide-legged body  
out onto the dark wheel

I have no mind for sextants  
of the faint telemetry of stars

So quick you are to become a speck  
lost at sea I worry up monsters  
buried in some trench of dreams  
though what's worse: you  
worry them ever greater, lurking  
together under Orion's sword
