Alligator

Maybe there were voices to tell him  
he was Icarus. Maybe it was drugs.  
Maybe he'd always wanted to know  
what it was like, just for a moment.

No witnesses. No reports. No trace.

From last step to landing a count  
of three-alligators. Time enough  
to swallow, shout and point out  
where he'd barely been.

One-alligator. Two-alligator. Three-alligator.

Quick as we could we started hunting  
for the black box. His orange shirt,  
the missing sandals on the street below.  
Wondering at the firemen in their slow step.

No body. No hurry. Nothing to see here, folks.

The hole he tore in the sky, gone  
in under an hour. Traffic back. Food carts  
serving up fresh gyros. The garlic sizzle  
tears a body up.

No name. No clue. Nothing to do.

Flag still flies at the top  
of the mast. Birds meander by.  
Never know what happened between  
all-knowing and nothing.

One-alligator. Two-alligator. Three-alligator.
