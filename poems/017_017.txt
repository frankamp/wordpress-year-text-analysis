fog

make us ineffectual ghosts

make us two shades deep

shade-on-shade

make us peer and squint

see what we can't possibly

make us startle

make us lost at home

shrubs for a map

dog calls a guide

make us afraid of bridges railings

barriers we built but forgot

make us small again

make us brave
