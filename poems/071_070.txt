Christ the man finds  
the frayed edge  
of himself, seamless  
garment torn. A flag  
in high wind. No sharp  
yell or recoil, just simple  
act of will: steady bending.  
The contortions required  
to keep it close and whole  
come natural, though  
not without cost. He learns  
a certain grimace, a cast  
of mouth and eye. Unbidden  
others come to mind: flayed  
garments, bodies broken  
and individual, each bearing  
their banner aloft, fluttering  
in some ungentle breeze.
