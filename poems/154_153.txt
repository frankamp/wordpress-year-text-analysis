Almonds

My latent racism tastes faintly  
of cyanide, tingling my tongue  
with a lazy epithet I hum off-hand  
& would never admit.

It worms its way up  
from where my nightshade grows,  
blooming warm in strident certitude  
& quickly withering.

Papery skin inside my skin  
catches in the back of my throat  
as an almond might  
choking, slowly poisoning.

If smell it on my breath  
though I've said nothing outright  
I'llÂ  deny deny deny  
but for the grit in my teeth.

When I die I pray they find a stump  
in me hacked and felled at the root, not  
this vibrant tree shaking  
bitter fruit.
