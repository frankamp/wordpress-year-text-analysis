Whittle

youÂ wait patiently  
to unfurl for me  
the dream you had  
more inspired  
than this trinket  
I'm bent on  
carving just now  
scattering shavings  
all over the bed  
whittling down  
this small bird  
that was a horse  
only a few strokes ago  
and soon will be  
the thumb I've cut  
bleeding if I keep on  
going leaving  
your dream  
and its reality  
for the top sheet  
quickly staining  
soaking up blood  
and words of sudden  
surprise
