//Fremont bridge on a foggy morning.//

Fremont

entering, the perfect curve  
commands. Westbound  
headlights hang in fog  
passing silently above  
their eastern brethren  
sweeping out over the city.  
Flags snap-to atop the arch  
saluting beauty, forged  
monument of our bent  
-willed industry.
