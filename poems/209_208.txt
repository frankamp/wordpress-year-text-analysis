Barnacle

He's the trench-coat wearing kind  
of kid who in his head hoists  
a boombox in the rain to serenade  
the love of his life.

He's a goldfish-in-the-castle  
keeping an eye out, hiding  
behind a jungle mustache  
and constant shrug.

He's microscopes and magic tricks  
that falter just enough to get you  
to hope and fall. He knew all along.  
You pull for him to be

the thing you'd expect: normalized  
in some unclear way. Less honest.  
More typically effervescent  
yet opaque.

He's who Darwin loved, maybe  
was, the salted carbuncle clinging  
to the hull, tasting the sea  
without getting shipwrecked.

Temperature-taker, side-eyer  
long-game-player, fantasizer  
who might just make it out  
of the box in his head, maybe

hitch a ride on a junk  
to China. Uncover a lost city  
and become a god to its people.  
Return home to settle

the rocking chair, bar stool  
in the back corner, nodding  
without ever giving up much  
nothing you'd never suspect.

He'll die or disappear  
with or without dates known,  
just a long line carved  
to keep us all guessing.
