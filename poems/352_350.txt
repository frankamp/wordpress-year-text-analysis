Advent (v)

hateful Advent full  
of pregnant waiting  
unsubstantiated claims of future  
coming kings as kings  
we want not babes becoming  
we love living _now_ _in_vent  
our modus operandi  
handmade golden bulls towers  
babbling down interconnected web  
we weave undaunted by what we can't  
wait on. appearing eastern stars? we go  
seek them out. birth? not even. now  
o come o come Emmanuel  
by c-section, stat, sent home  
we're tired of your holy game  
of wait and see of abide  
in me and love of me  
of wait and see what comes
