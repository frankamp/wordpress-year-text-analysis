Station

Christ the man cracks  
pistachios in the bar car.  
Split shells fill an ashtray,  
spill out, run over.  
The Sound slips by,  
Tacoma, Tukwila,  
southbound circuit.  
He will return to rain  
and obscurity. To work  
the same ground over  
and again. No love  
in his native land.  
He dozes, head in hand,  
dreams of Florida,  
of warm beaches,  
of palms. A different track  
were only possible. Wakes  
to the conductor warning  
five minutes, all doors,  
all passengers, five minutes  
to station, end of the line.
