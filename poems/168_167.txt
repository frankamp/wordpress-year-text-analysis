Genetics

We evolved under the jack pine  
our mammoth dark selves spread

out against the greater dark  
lit through fire and tales

told with inward stares  
while behind the million eyes

watch glinting green  
the shamanic dance

the cones make spilling  
their seeds out

on the ground charred  
into life

we smear the scent of pine  
oil in our beards

trailing smoke  
and ashes

carrying the fire  
deeper in
