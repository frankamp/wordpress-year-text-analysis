				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cigarette</p>
<p>is of French extraction,<br />
which you’d think would light up<br />
his colonized mind, but<br />
his borders have been crossed<br />
so often he can’t remember<br />
the words he comes from.<br />
His native tongue’s locked up.<br />
Every idiom is wrong, syntax<br />
clashes, grammar runs against<br />
the olive wood grain.<br />
There is no mint, no yellow cumin<br />
in his speech. He smokes cheap<br />
tobacco in the yard, smuggled<br />
dry Virginia leaf, Marlboros<br />
that smear his fingers,<br />
stain the crescent moons hung<br />
under his nails. He daydreams<br />
figs and dates, a little hash,<br />
hot sand so far from the blue<br />
of concrete blocks. At night he lies<br />
in his small cot, a boat<br />
among all the other boats, floating<br />
down the Nile of his mind, knowing<br />
every tree and bird, waiting for the stars<br />
so he can call them each by name.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pea &amp; The Claw</p>
<p>Once I would&#8217;ve cursed the runner<br />
when we collided on the bridge.<br />
He cut the corner (or did I?)<br />
and left bleeding, stumbling<br />
down the ramp. His frightened hand<br />
pressed my chest. His face is a blur<br />
I make up.</p>
<p>Lately my mind is full of this: a pea<br />
attended to by a shoot, silver-white<br />
and tailing. A tremulous light at work<br />
being a tremulous light, lit some unknown way.<br />
It needs help, I know&#8211;how do I know?<br />
&#8211;to survive in the void.</p>
<p>So when I shouted, &#8220;Jesus,<br />
fuck!&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t to turn the runner<br />
to a pillar of stone, raze his crops<br />
and salt the land. In that harried instant<br />
I called down protection on us all, against<br />
the curse every man knows and its rooting<br />
claw, dark, digging to unseat<br />
such sudden sprouting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the NHS Induction Ceremony</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of amazing to watch them<br />
skate across the expanse<br />
of this big black stage, just barely,<br />
in rumpled suits and heels<br />
and starter mustaches. They joke<br />
with each other, wave awkwardly<br />
to their parents, shake hands<br />
and accept their certificate,<br />
always on the verge<br />
of missing a step and falling<br />
into the shimmering shadow<br />
of themselves projected up<br />
from the dark. It&#8217;s like they don&#8217;t know<br />
it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s like they are only aware<br />
of the bright shining light that they cast.<br />
Which will be the first to go out?<br />
Which will light a thousands suns?<br />
I clap when prompted, but absently,<br />
watching their parents and the smiles<br />
that hide the fear of the questions,<br />
applauding so forcefully their hands glow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thirty-One</p>
<p>Thirty-one is like twenty-one<br />
but ten years on. Go ahead. Play<br />
laser tag in the park at dark.<br />
Drink too much. Have your gluten-free cake<br />
and eat it, too. Let your friends care<br />
for you as you puke, just a little,<br />
in their manicured bathroom.<br />
Stay out later than is wise tonight.<br />
Work comes early. Write a poem<br />
to commemorate. Bones<br />
and back sore, lids at half-mast,<br />
heart-happy endure<br />
this aging body another year.<br />
Worse and better,<br />
more than can be known,<br />
to come. Happy, happy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emergency</p>
<p>It takes an emergency squad at least 20 minutes to arrive<br />
(usually longer) and the car will sink long before they get there.</p>
<p>The dead beaver in the bike lane, its tail badly hacked off, gave it look<br />
like it was shitting its own innards.</p>
<p>I have cried over less.</p>
<p>The river bridge is still two bridges bridging towards itself.</p>
<p>The wings make a sound in wind like a rare tree frog or tiny bird: <em>tilikum tilikum</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to make sure someone knows you love them, you have to<br />
ask them to stop talking and look at you, just for a second.</p>
<p>Their eyes may seem like the eyes of a person inside a sinking car.</p>
<p>Make a small sound for them, like a rare bird, to say<br />
<em>I am here, I am here.</p>
<p></em>Place your hand on their hand. Matching<br />
tails full of blood-warmth.</p>
<p>They may cry. Don&#8217;t worry. Forget about the car.</p>
<p>The emergency is over.</p>
<p>The emergency is over.</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
a) First post-Lent poem. Nice/weird to be out of the container.<br />
b) The first line is from a spam-bot that &#8220;commented&#8221; on my site. Thanks, spam-bot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easter</p>
<p>Christ the man tingles<br />
in his skin again. The fit<br />
of fingers, weight of skin<br />
and bone, the song<br />
his blood sings. I am<br />
who I am, he says<br />
to the bolted door.<br />
The other side is grief<br />
and fear, a room full<br />
of emptied men. He holds<br />
out his hand in blessing.<br />
Lock and board give way,<br />
a veil parting. Unseen<br />
he returns, enters again<br />
the lives of others.<br />
In their midst as Christ,<br />
as man.</p>

<p>Christ the man is<br />
and is not. Dead<br />
to life, alive in death.<br />
What of the man<br />
remains? Where<br />
and to what end?<br />
When, if when<br />
is a word worth<br />
meaning. <em>Day</em><br />
does not mean <em>day</em><br />
among the dead.<br />
The living are left<br />
to wait and wonder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday</p>
<p>Christ the man cancels<br />
the newspaper and holds<br />
the mail. He strips the bed,<br />
beats the rugs and towels.<br />
He washes windows, fills holes<br />
with putty. One afternoon<br />
he hunts down every loose nail<br />
and doorknob. He cleans out<br />
the refrigerator, sweeps the garage,<br />
scrubs the yellow stain<br />
around the toilet. He mows<br />
and edges, trims the hedge.<br />
It takes a week.<br />
The truck sells for nothing;<br />
the cash slipped under the door<br />
of the neighbor who never liked him.<br />
The rest of his worldly possessions&#8211;<br />
pocketknife, fishing pole and line,<br />
several books and cigarettes&#8211;<br />
fit in a box he puts on the curb.<br />
Key lies under the mat. Linens<br />
he leaves folded at the foot of the bed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maundy</p>
<p>Christ the man rolls<br />
up his sleeves and jeans,<br />
kneeling in the dark.<br />
Frankincense blooms<br />
in a bucket of hot water.<br />
The others, his brothers<br />
ringed in a circle, breathe<br />
deeply, deeply unsure.<br />
A silent nod and he begins.<br />
Heels, nails, the space<br />
between the toes. His hands<br />
are firm but gentle, cleansing<br />
with intention. He blessses<br />
each man, thanking him<br />
for being served. And the next.<br />
And the next. And so on.<br />
It goes on all night. It goes on still.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bistro</p>
<p>Christ the man thinks<br />
of the things he could burn<br />
thirty bucks on. Beer and cigarettes.<br />
A tank of gas. New pants. A hot shave<br />
and haircut. A decent bottle<br />
of cologne. Happy hour<br />
for two. Nowhere special.<br />
A cheese board with crusty bread,<br />
green olives, good red wine.<br />
Some out of the way bistro<br />
to talk honestly with a friend,<br />
lay everything out between them<br />
on the small table. Look hard<br />
at it. Come to some decision.<br />
Or he could give it away<br />
to the poor and hungry,<br />
to the endless needy<br />
who have neither bread or wine.</p>
