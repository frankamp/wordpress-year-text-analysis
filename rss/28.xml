<p>Christ the man wanders<br />
the wine aisle, lingering<br />
amidst pinots&#8217; dark<br />
tannins and depth<br />
of dusky grapes, crushed.<br />
Just a small dinner<br />
among friends. He waves off<br />
the steward&#8217;s suggestion<br />
of bargain bottles.<br />
He&#8217;ll gladly pay. Yet<br />
finds he doesn&#8217;t<br />
want to choose.<br />
The hour grows late.<br />
The party has begun.<br />
The loaf, fresh<br />
in his hand, still warm,<br />
is slowly going cold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fig</p>
<p>Christ the man curses<br />
down the fig tree. Dead<br />
limbs drop rotten fruit<br />
on his side of the fence.<br />
Black flies and bees descend<br />
in swarm. The hungry mob<br />
sounds a thousand, five thousand<br />
strong. A crawling mass,<br />
a creeping skin of mouths<br />
consumes the putrid body,<br />
dumped as if in haste in long weeds<br />
and wildflowers. What sweetness<br />
lingers he knows as loss.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palm</p>
<p>Christ the man suffers<br />
peroxide in the ugly cut.<br />
Pruning saw bucked<br />
sudden, caught laurel&#8217;s<br />
tough edge, tore his palm.<br />
Bloodied leaves trace<br />
a hurried path, wreath<br />
his disheveled head.<br />
Hiss and cleansing sting<br />
rush out. The pulse<br />
shuddering his wrist<br />
fascinates&#8211;echo<br />
of his truest self<br />
bleeding into<br />
sink&#8217;s stark bowl,<br />
mingling brightened red<br />
and dirtied white, pooling<br />
a moment in the bell<br />
before submitting<br />
to drain&#8217;s dark pull.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gamble</p>
<p>Christ the man gambles<br />
the last of his nights away<br />
on cards he cares little for.<br />
It&#8217;s the men at table,<br />
the feel of money<br />
slipping or piling<br />
on a bluff, a whim<br />
he deals in for. The turn,<br />
the draw, the river coming<br />
in his favor or hard against.<br />
He bides his time, lying low<br />
at the table, telling nothing<br />
while his brothers spout<br />
and coerce, badger, live<br />
as if it meant nothing.<br />
The drink and smoke.<br />
The long dark hours.<br />
He cherishes it all,<br />
going all in at last<br />
near the break of day.<br />
The final flop comes<br />
to tired eyes. A single card.<br />
He folds without a word,<br />
that last guarded hand<br />
a final testament.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hip</p>
<p>Christ the man salves<br />
the coroded hip joint<br />
out of true for ages.<br />
Peter bites his lip,<br />
holds him steady<br />
in his anguish. The rock<br />
their fists make: one<br />
sunken in the tomb<br />
of the unforgiving tub,<br />
the other a ladder<br />
to cling to. Their eyes<br />
bind a tether. He cries out<br />
at the end of his rope,<br />
shrouded in the sound<br />
of his own dying voice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ebenezer</p>
<p>Christ the man says aloud<br />
the places he&#8217;ll leave behind:<br />
Kings Hill, Goose Hollow,<br />
Buckman, Old Town, Irvington,<br />
Skidmore. A list made map<br />
incarnate. Each name<br />
distinct, each name<br />
an Ebenezer carved<br />
from the heart&#8217;s quarry,<br />
his body ringing<br />
with the work of shearing<br />
and shaping. Each name<br />
a weight that keeps him<br />
close to earth and water<br />
a little longer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blessing</p>
<p>Christ the man counts<br />
each drawn breath<br />
a blessing. An <em>ER</em><br />
rerun is on TV<br />
in the other half<br />
of the curtained room.<br />
The man lying there<br />
behind the veil<br />
won&#8217;t lie there for long.<br />
His young charge sleeps on<br />
despite the ruckus.<br />
Blood cleanses itself,<br />
lungs take air, release,<br />
take air again. Peace.<br />
A woman yells, alarms sound,<br />
and for one hectic moment<br />
the two rooms mingle. Between<br />
worlds. Which is the real?<br />
Christ the man bows his head<br />
to count each breath, blessing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gin</p>
<p>Christ the man shakes<br />
hands in common greeting<br />
and farewell. Exhausted<br />
from the effort he retires<br />
to porch swing and gin,<br />
to afternoon of silent<br />
remembrance. Violets<br />
and rosemary along the walk.<br />
Names and faces of the many,<br />
the particular shape<br />
of each hand in his&#8211;like wax<br />
he holds the imprint.<br />
His creased palms the same<br />
as theirs, singing silent<br />
psalms of fear and shield,<br />
of hope and forgive. Gin<br />
-warm he sings low under<br />
his heated breath, sings<br />
down the afternoon, his hands<br />
clasped in thanksgiving.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barbecue</p>
<p>Christ the man salsas<br />
barefoot across the lawn,<br />
a soft but rigid frame<br />
for Yvonne to ply against.<br />
In rhythm they quarter<br />
turn and turn again.<br />
Their laughter turns heads<br />
of neighbors mingling<br />
in mild conversation<br />
about promotions, vacation<br />
plans, yard work woes,<br />
homeowners&#8217; dues.<br />
Children join in but<br />
are quickly pulled aside.<br />
They smile wide and<br />
put more hip into it.<br />
Her blackened curls, flagrant<br />
as her reputation, shimmy<br />
in time. They mar the grass<br />
with Latin flair; rutted proof<br />
of their abandon. The music fades<br />
to forced static. She leans in<br />
to kiss his cheek in gratitude.<br />
He lets it linger, savoring the holy<br />
press in her lips.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Station</p>
<p>Christ the man cracks<br />
pistachios in the bar car.<br />
Split shells fill an ashtray,<br />
spill out, run over.<br />
The Sound slips by,<br />
Tacoma, Tukwila,<br />
southbound circuit.<br />
He will return to rain<br />
and obscurity. To work<br />
the same ground over<br />
and again. No love<br />
in his native land.<br />
He dozes, head in hand,<br />
dreams of Florida,<br />
of warm beaches,<br />
of palms. A different track<br />
were only possible. Wakes<br />
to the conductor warning<br />
five minutes, all doors,<br />
all passengers, five minutes<br />
to station, end of the line.</p>
