				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;The work we are&#8217;</p>
<p>The work we are<br />
about to enter is the work<br />
of not being</p>
<p>The beveled blade<br />
turns earth turns rock<br />
turns persistent weed under</p>
<p>We follow the leading of the blade<br />
we place upon the path of cinders<br />
we are given</p>
<p>If we open our mouths if we stand<br />
upright it is to make<br />
room it is only to empty ourselves</p>
<p>We will work the ground we are<br />
given to make the path we are<br />
on with the blade</p>
<p>We will learn the blade intimately<br />
intimately we will learn the ground<br />
and the row</p>
<p>We will be taught in time to turn<br />
the earth the roots the rock<br />
the cinders the persistent weed</p>
<p>The work of this season<br />
will bury us<br />
for a time</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Cake</p>
<p>Here we are on the edge<br />
again. Lenten desert<br />
of unleavened emptiness.<br />
But not yet: bake off<br />
the last of the good fats<br />
lest they spoil. Fold in<br />
the sugar and the Baby,<br />
twist the dough. Dust it<br />
with royal color. Pour out<br />
the wine and spirits<br />
as you toast to the end<br />
of all merriness, holler<br />
the season’s last hallelujah.<br />
See your ashes are in order,<br />
for tomorrow we die<br />
the first of many small deaths.<br />
But not yet, no! Feast<br />
one final time. Raise a glass<br />
and savor the <i>gallete des rois</i>.<br />
Let the plastic savior gentle<br />
against the back of your teeth;<br />
taste the sensation<br />
you’ve swallowed something more<br />
than bread and wine. Live tonight<br />
for tomorrow we die.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fireworks</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to set off fireworks<br />
all night, flicking the Zippo<br />
with a cool nonchalance, swaggering<br />
to the MGD bottle in the driveway<br />
jammed with a bouquet of bottle rockets<br />
lighting the quick rat-tail fuse I rigged up<br />
waiting for the thousand screams<br />
&amp; hot-pop explosions corkscrewing<br />
over the neighborhood, landing on roofs<br />
freaking out the resident dog population<br />
waiting for my friends taking cover<br />
in the garage to high five me<br />
because, dude, so awesome, right?<br />
I was even ready to get arrested<br />
to spend the night in the clink<br />
for the story (and all the glory<br />
it would bestow).</p>
<p>But all I have is this<br />
stupid little charcoal snake<br />
I found in a wet-bottomed box<br />
in the basement. It sparks small<br />
and smokes, burns itself into itself<br />
a small black turdlet unspooling<br />
all over the driveway. It leaves<br />
a stain and inspires not one<br />
of my friends who isn&#8217;t here<br />
to watch. It&#8217;s just a pile<br />
of ash, in the end. I think<br />
to wash it off, but leave it<br />
to blow away with the wind<br />
mix in with the neighbors&#8217; roses<br />
fertilize the dead<br />
grass under the shade tree<br />
where I&#8217;ll sit tonight<br />
and watch the stars instead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fence</p>
<p>The something in us that doesn&#8217;t love<br />
a wall wonders aloud</p>
<p>how a whole state nearly became<br />
a lonely stretch of country road</p>
<p>at night in Wyoming.<br />
We shrug and turn back to our work</p>
<p>auguring the last holes,<br />
setting the posts.</p>
<p>Someone says &#8220;Elves!&#8221; and the laugh<br />
that comes is the sound</p>
<p>of barbed wire shivering<br />
in its shining coil.</p>
<p>Staples gouge gnarled posts<br />
precise.</p>
<p>With the last of our strength,<br />
all our muscle, we tension the wire</p>
<p>pulling tighter, tight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heritage</p>
<p>The backyard littered<br />
with paper entrails, hard candies<br />
passed over for butterscotch<br />
and the red buttons of sugar<br />
the dissolve on the tongue. Taints lips<br />
and spit. The little devils ran foot races<br />
in celebration. The oak<br />
planted back three generations<br />
hangs its head: it holds<br />
the mangled body still, colored<br />
ribbons flutter flesh<br />
chicken wire mangles bones.<br />
Before the mob his dancing<br />
dangling jig lasted only minutes.<br />
The bat was borrowed.<br />
Their cackling at his sudden rupture<br />
raised the dogs. Their eyes grew<br />
as he slowly gave way. They cursed<br />
the blindness, the failed stab. I held<br />
the rope for my own, steady, centered.<br />
He took the head. Some dirtied knees<br />
in the rush. They’ve gone away, slumped<br />
against heavier chests, worn out<br />
by a taste for aggression<br />
not yet named but seething.<br />
The cord is knotted tight<br />
around the branch and will not quit.<br />
It strained them<br />
and those who held them back<br />
along the perforated lines<br />
where God made us to break<br />
but not yet. Not yet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dam (for H.C.)</p>
<p>Nights such as these<br />
when an absent airplane<br />
keeps me awake, nervous<br />
carving its way through the dark</p>
<p>I wish for a hermit&#8217;s beard<br />
a thick, crazy-making beard<br />
and bushy, bulging eyebrows<br />
white, to match</p>
<p>A symbol<br />
something to excuse<br />
the way I tinker, worry<br />
my fingers over my knee<br />
in old-man fashion</p>
<p>Such nights as these I leave a lamp on.</p>
<p>I dig out old Hayden Carruth<br />
a book of his last poems<br />
I pour myself several fingers<br />
of whatever&#8217;s on hand</p>
<p>I wait for the plane noise<br />
to fade, the hole it makes<br />
to close</p>
<p>The warmth comes slowly<br />
I settle in<br />
to Hayden&#8217;s voice<br />
as I imagine it</p>
<p>After a while I let the guards off<br />
Take it easy on me, boys, I say<br />
to myself<br />
All posts abandoned<br />
what comes, comes</p>
<p>Not much fit<br />
to be recorded or recalled<br />
in the bluebird light<br />
of day, but some</p>
<p>And that is enough<br />
to begin to build<br />
the dam<br />
against the next night<br />
and the next</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inherent Right</p>
<p>I&#8217;m laid out<br />
wrestling with<br />
Wolterstorff<br />
on justice<br />
and inherent rights<br />
when you come pawing<br />
at my chest, seeking<br />
a place to curl<br />
and keep me company.</p>
<p>Annoyed, burned out<br />
by the philosophical<br />
jargon I&#8217;m battling<br />
to come to some understanding<br />
of how I ought and ought not<br />
to treat my fellows,<br />
plus damn, man,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m plain<br />
worn out<br />
from a long day packed<br />
with my fellow man,<br />
so you are rebuffed<br />
most unjustly:<br />
the back of my hand<br />
sends you off.</p>
<p>But<br />
how quickly you return<br />
regardless of my mood<br />
or inclinations,<br />
claiming the right<br />
to your preferred perch<br />
unaware or uncaring<br />
of any justice<br />
but that which is inalienable<br />
endowed by the Creator<br />
even to the likes of you.</p>
<p>I hold out<br />
as long as humanly possible<br />
against your persistent nudging<br />
but finally cave (allegorically),<br />
put down this tome<br />
and let you learn me<br />
a thing or two<br />
about the true nature<br />
of justice.</p>
