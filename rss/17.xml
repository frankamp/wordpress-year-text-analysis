				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blackberry</p>
<p>despite the heat we have<br />
no orange trees<br />
like Thich Nhat Hanh<br />
to eat from<br />
take instead the fruit<br />
off the vine<br />
weaving between spines<br />
pluck one plump berry<br />
black and shining<br />
cloistered in cupped hands<br />
a censer crushed slow<br />
against the teeth<br />
tasting sweetly sour<br />
blooming in the mouth<br />
a moment drawn<br />
forever</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Night Deposit</p>
<p>Girl, I love watching you puzzle<br />
out our financial future<br />
with a .05mm mechanical pencil<br />
and a calculator from Dollar Tree.</p>
<p>That twisted tongue stuck out your mouth<br />
makes me want to make the baby<br />
we&#8217;re saving all this up for.</p>
<p>College funds. Baby saving plan. 401(k)s.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get down on a plush cushion of down payments.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s work up some sweat equity.</p>
<p>With a 3% interest rate locked in<br />
until death do us part, you can amortize<br />
this ROI anytime you want.</p>
<p>No line to wait in. No bullet proof glass<br />
or secret PIN required.</p>
<p>This Any Time Man&#8217;s always open<br />
for a night deposit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am who I am</p>
<p>Who do you say that I am? Christ Almighty<br />
what an artful dodge. His wine goblet runneth over<br />
at a crowded house party, pressed to the counter,<br />
gently deflecting the question. Yeshua bar-Yoesf<br />
always was good with a slick finish, even if<br />
he went against the grain. Never one for straight answers.<br />
A parable man, digging in the dirt when the shit came down,<br />
then losing it in a spastic rage. Love and swords; wheat and chaff<br />
and hushing up the healed. Hard to pin down until the end.<br />
What&#8217;s to be done with you, son? Been called many things;<br />
I&#8217;ve got a few thoughts of my own. But who you are? Hell if I know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alligator</p>
<p>Maybe there were voices to tell him<br />
he was Icarus. Maybe it was drugs.<br />
Maybe he&#8217;d always wanted to know<br />
what it was like, just for a moment.</p>
<p>No witnesses. No reports. No trace.</p>
<p>From last step to landing a count<br />
of three-alligators. Time enough<br />
to swallow, shout and point out<br />
where he&#8217;d barely been.</p>
<p>One-alligator. Two-alligator. Three-alligator.</p>
<p>Quick as we could we started hunting<br />
for the black box. His orange shirt,<br />
the missing sandals on the street below.<br />
Wondering at the firemen in their slow step.</p>
<p>No body. No hurry. Nothing to see here, folks.</p>
<p>The hole he tore in the sky, gone<br />
in under an hour. Traffic back. Food carts<br />
serving up fresh gyros. The garlic sizzle<br />
tears a body up.</p>
<p>No name. No clue. Nothing to do.</p>
<p>Flag still flies at the top<br />
of the mast. Birds meander by.<br />
Never know what happened between<br />
all-knowing and nothing.</p>
<p>One-alligator. Two-alligator. Three-alligator.</p>

<p><em>*On 7/30/14, a man fell/lept/was pushed from the roof of an office building in SW Portland.</em></p>
<p>Accidental: He happened to get too close to the edge.</p>
<p>Cry for Help:  It was a thought he didn&#8217;t want.</p>
<p>Delusional: He was out of his mind.</p>
<p>Hesitantly Intentional: He knew what he was doing, but slipped into it.</p>
<p>Committed: He wore running shoes.</p>
<p>Crime of Passion: They fought; he fell.</p>
<p>Crime of Opportunity: Drugs or money and a slick edge.</p>
<p>Homicide: Personal and/or professional malice.</p>
<p>Nihilistic: Does it matter?</p>
<p>Act of God: a Divine reminder.</p>

<p>Don the hand<br />
from the remains<br />
of the crater.</p>
<p>Find shrapnel to pierce<br />
and thread twine<br />
through the thick wrist.</p>
<p>Second heartbeat claps heavy<br />
against your chest<br />
when next you run to shelter.</p>
<p>Phantom-flex of the dead<br />
fingers reach out<br />
to all you pass.</p>
<p>Hammered ring glints<br />
gold. A little fire<br />
huddled in the dark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tabernacle</p>
<p>If the body&#8217;s a temple<br />
I&#8217;m a trapaulin tent<br />
animal skin stretched over bone<br />
braces, made for travel<br />
and quick packing<br />
at the sight of trouble<br />
or the descending Whirlwind.</p>
<p>Ages of dust and incense can&#8217;t scrub<br />
the blood clean. Smell of hair<br />
and the last moments of slaughter<br />
before being raised up<br />
to new life. The cross-beams<br />
fail; the hide panels wear out.</p>
<p>Carted around the desert<br />
at the mercy of hands<br />
that don&#8217;t understand their own<br />
function. Left out to be filled<br />
with the punishing wind<br />
that clenases</p>
<p>and fills a moment whole<br />
then gone, deflated, empty<br />
of anything but the space held<br />
a space of nothing waiting<br />
for the next roiling storm<br />
to roll across the desert</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barnacle</p>
<p>He&#8217;s the trench-coat wearing kind<br />
of kid who in his head hoists<br />
a boombox in the rain to serenade<br />
the love of his life.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a goldfish-in-the-castle<br />
keeping an eye out, hiding<br />
behind a jungle mustache<br />
and constant shrug.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s microscopes and magic tricks<br />
that falter just enough to get you<br />
to hope and fall. He knew all along.<br />
You pull for him to be</p>
<p>the thing you&#8217;d expect: normalized<br />
in some unclear way. Less honest.<br />
More typically effervescent<br />
yet opaque.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s who Darwin loved, maybe<br />
was, the salted carbuncle clinging<br />
to the hull, tasting the sea<br />
without getting shipwrecked.</p>
<p>Temperature-taker, side-eyer<br />
long-game-player, fantasizer<br />
who might just make it out<br />
of the box in his head, maybe</p>
<p>hitch a ride on a junk<br />
to China. Uncover a lost city<br />
and become a god to its people.<br />
Return home to settle</p>
<p>the rocking chair, bar stool<br />
in the back corner, nodding<br />
without ever giving up much<br />
nothing you&#8217;d never suspect.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll die or disappear<br />
with or without dates known,<br />
just a long line carved<br />
to keep us all guessing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Funeral for the Father of the Bride</p>
<p>Flip the bouquets, swap the black ribbon<br />
for white lace, gin up the organ some,<br />
loosen your tie a little and holler<br />
new hymns to the choir. Rose petals&#8217;ll smile<br />
just as well as wilt.<br />
The minister&#8217;s worth his salt: tragedy shimmers<br />
into joy in the blink of an eye. <em>Do you? Do you?</em><br />
Stand and clap at the kiss&#8211;the old man won&#8217;t roll,<br />
from his vantage he knows the tears do double-duty.<br />
Afterwards, out on the green lawn, toast him under<br />
and the new couple to a long and happy life,<br />
God-willing. Shake the warm hands around you,<br />
swap stories of the young and the dead. Wear a tread<br />
in the dance floor, savoring your brief moment<br />
with the shinning bride. Drink deep of the wine,<br />
see them off at last light in a shower of rice and light.<br />
On the long walk back, hum a funeral dirge in the dark,<br />
at home in your one good suit.</p>
