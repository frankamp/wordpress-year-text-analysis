				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stella</p>
<p>Christ the man vegges out<br />
with <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>,<br />
a half-rack and a pint of Cherry Garcia<br />
because sometimes a man needs<br />
to kick off his shoes, curl up<br />
under an old wool blanket<br />
and let go the angry man<br />
at the Plaid Pantry ranting<br />
about gov&#8217;t healthcare,<br />
sidestep the gutterpunks<br />
asking for money to feed<br />
their menagerie, say thanks<br />
but no thanks to the woman<br />
with the bright and twitchy smile<br />
canvassing for a worthy cause.<br />
Sometimes a man just needs<br />
to let it be. Also: Brando.<br />
So he locks the door,<br />
cracks a cold one,<br />
and for just one night<br />
lets the great world spin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Phone</p>
<p>Christ the man calls<br />
his brother on the phone<br />
every weekend.<br />
Like clock work:<br />
an hour, to the minute,<br />
every Sunday.<br />
It&#8217;s mostly silence<br />
and heavy breathing.<br />
What the other<br />
does, what the other<br />
might have been<br />
goes unsaid. Grief<br />
is the electric hollow<br />
of an open line.<br />
Every hour ends<br />
the same: time up,<br />
right hands spread wide,<br />
fingers and palms matched<br />
in width and color,<br />
pressed to thick glass<br />
that says all they<br />
never will. Led away<br />
without the other,<br />
alone again. But not<br />
alone. Not ever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feast</p>
<p>Christ the man ponders<br />
the hop-along pigeon<br />
chasing bread crumbs<br />
at the back of the brutal flock.<br />
She&#8217;s missing her left foot<br />
toes, torn off or ignored<br />
by life&#8217;s dark machinery.<br />
Peg-leg bird hobbling.<br />
Always the last to feed,<br />
doomed never to mate,<br />
the least of these<br />
hundred others.<br />
She knows no other.<br />
Unruffled, she flaps<br />
flying into the scrum<br />
to win her dear portion.<br />
He leads her away<br />
to feast on fresh bread,<br />
a whole baguette, hers,<br />
for the pecking. No fight<br />
or flight. Her hidden coloring<br />
flashes in the sun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miracle</p>
<p>Christ the man startles<br />
the ghost out of the machine.<br />
In a noisy airport bathroom<br />
the paper towel appears<br />
with a wave of his hand.<br />
Faucets and urinals run<br />
of their own accord.<br />
The spirit moves. Men<br />
filter in and out, moving<br />
in an unspoken dance,<br />
bearing every manner of dress<br />
and language, each intent<br />
on destinations they know<br />
intimately and not at all.<br />
They will plane and deplane<br />
in distant cities<br />
and think nothing of it,<br />
complaining of lost time<br />
or kneeling to greet their children.<br />
They will step down out of the air<br />
as if it is their right.<br />
He will meet them there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crown</p>
<p>Christ the man smokes<br />
a hand-rolled cigarette<br />
with the kid at the bus stop<br />
since he offered. He hears<br />
about neck tattoos covering<br />
bruises, about sleeping in<br />
the waiting room, about mornings<br />
made of shaking hands.<br />
He learns the shape and weight<br />
of what Gabriel carries,<br />
if that is his name<br />
stitched above his heart.<br />
The smoke demons his lungs<br />
and stains his fingers.<br />
He crushes it beneath his heel<br />
but will wake tasting it,<br />
his mouth sour and stale.<br />
It will burrow into his clothes.<br />
He will learn to wear it<br />
like a crown.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Massage</p>
<p>Christ the man succumbs<br />
to hands upon his body.<br />
Gentle pressure comes<br />
with violence. Muscles<br />
tensed and knotted quaver<br />
against the bone, cry out.<br />
He knows himself as a sapling<br />
shaken by wind.<br />
In softened dark,<br />
amidst the brethren<br />
and their quieting canting,<br />
alone again. Smell of cedar.<br />
His body comes slowly back,<br />
all the broken bits aligning.<br />
So many parts<br />
gone so horribly wrong<br />
to make him whole.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cedar</p>
<p>Christ the man tastes<br />
cedar on the wind. Rain<br />
storms its way down valley<br />
swamping the low-lands.<br />
The crops he tilled last week<br />
may drown or survive.<br />
Far west an eagle turns<br />
a slow swath, ignoring<br />
the coming storm. Lord<br />
of the air claims his own.<br />
Lord of the air rides out<br />
what comes to shake him.<br />
He leans to on the porch,<br />
waiting. The first drops fall,<br />
the smell of cedar rises.</p>

<p>Christ the man centered<br />
among men. At table,<br />
at work, at play.<br />
Sanded skin conducts<br />
crisp current. So many minds<br />
he longs to pick the lock of.<br />
Settles for the press of chest<br />
to chest, slow breath, the deep<br />
well of eye to eye in a man<br />
well met or wounded. He centers<br />
himself among men<br />
to find how it is to lose<br />
himself, to be found.</p>
