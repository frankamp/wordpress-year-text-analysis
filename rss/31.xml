				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asea</p>
<p>Christ the man gives up<br />
everything he holds<br />
into the plastic bowl.<br />
Sudden boundary<br />
of his new world.<br />
He learns the intimate<br />
smell of himself.<br />
All night long he rides<br />
nausea as a sailor,<br />
breathing deep<br />
through the valleys,<br />
but the sudden twist within<br />
will not be quelled.<br />
No calm sea, no sleep.<br />
On the raft of sheets<br />
the world goes by. Sidewalk<br />
voices, music from next door<br />
filter from another world.<br />
One&#8217;s will he begins<br />
to understand isn&#8217;t always<br />
what is done. The body taken<br />
from the mind: acrid taste<br />
of what&#8217;s to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Selfie</p>
<p>Christ the man poses<br />
on an empty pier,<br />
alone but for the waves.<br />
His right arm cranes away,<br />
angling to swallow the whole<br />
Pacific rolled out behind,<br />
his face forever imposed upon it.<br />
Salted wind and crying gulls<br />
will not appear. No proof<br />
of the thousand steps<br />
smothered beneath the surf.<br />
A clutch of pale sand scooped<br />
into a jar meant for preserves;<br />
a pearled shell the home<br />
of some vanished body;<br />
bits of pale blue glass<br />
smooth as water.<br />
These he keeps for the mantle altar.<br />
The cock-eyed image of Christ<br />
the man, awkward icon,<br />
badly lit and out of focus,<br />
taped to his morning mirror.<br />
The face looking back<br />
at the face, as into a sea<br />
unending.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fruit</p>
<p>Christ the man swallows<br />
a rusty bit of wind-fall<br />
apple nestled in the weeds.<br />
Its flesh takes on his teeth.<br />
He waits. The day is digging<br />
itself a grave, warm and soiled<br />
in late summer. Grasshoppers<br />
flit and he thinks of eyelids<br />
in the midst of dreams.<br />
The apple has yellowed<br />
of its own accord, mealing over<br />
in his hand. Rot&#8217;s a thing<br />
to see up close, he says,<br />
but not endure. He eats it<br />
whole, brittle core and bitter<br />
pips in turn. The stem he saves,<br />
a tiny flag to prick his hand<br />
on the long road home,<br />
remind him of the sweetness<br />
and the sacrifice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tabernacle</p>
<p>Christ the man stalks<br />
the Jos. A Banks store<br />
at the mall, slipping in<br />
and out of the expensive<br />
and inexpensive suits<br />
on his lunch break.<br />
He&#8217;s come to love<br />
the weight and glide<br />
of silk and nylon<br />
against his skin.<br />
Cool blue pin-stripes,<br />
the gray houndstooth<br />
of his eyes. The swish<br />
of fabric on the rack.<br />
A sabeled leather smell imbues<br />
the salesman&#8217;s quiet canting,<br />
weaving a holy space.<br />
The appointed hour comes;<br />
he exits quiet as he came. Leaving<br />
the jacket void, formless<br />
without his shape to hold,<br />
hung again with care<br />
upon a wooden hanger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Witness</p>
<p>Christ the man sobs<br />
with such luxuriant abandon<br />
it sets the neighbor dogs to.<br />
Kitchen conversations pause<br />
and lawn mowers sputter dead.<br />
Afternoon passers-by tent<br />
hands as shade for eyes<br />
in witness of this front-porch<br />
unraveling. The sound is a<br />
lamentation not wholly born.<br />
His beer bottle sweats a ring<br />
on the stoop in solidarity<br />
while the flower bed,<br />
freshly mulched and turned<br />
as somewhere church choirs sang,<br />
gives off the warming smell<br />
of promise. He wipes his nose<br />
and red-eyed sees the small<br />
part of his world&#8211;ordered<br />
streets, a litany of jays, the dogs<br />
given to their lounging, quiet now<br />
&#8211;and knows that it is good.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standard</p>
<p>Christ the man finds<br />
the frayed edge<br />
of himself, seamless<br />
garment torn. A flag<br />
in high wind. No sharp<br />
yell or recoil, just simple<br />
act of will: steady bending.<br />
The contortions required<br />
to keep it close and whole<br />
come natural, though<br />
not without cost. He learns<br />
a certain grimace, a cast<br />
of mouth and eye. Unbidden<br />
others come to mind: flayed<br />
garments, bodies broken<br />
and individual, each bearing<br />
their banner aloft, fluttering<br />
in some ungentle breeze.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Letter</p>
<p>Christ the man kisses<br />
the blood from the slim cut<br />
and envelope&#8217;s sticky lip.<br />
Tastes iron. Spoons bloom<br />
in his mind. All day long<br />
he feels the thumb in a new way:<br />
distinct in pain, alert<br />
to the limits healing has.<br />
The disconcerting absence of feeling<br />
a band-aid makes possible.<br />
Each painful throb reminds him<br />
of the letter sent, lost<br />
in a sharp, shuffling sea of letters,<br />
also lost, bearing out into the world<br />
the red stamp of his hand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throne</p>
<p>Christ the man<br />
brushes robin&#8217;s egg<br />
blue on in calm strokes,<br />
a sea covering the chair<br />
rescued from obscurity.<br />
Planed and oiled over<br />
many nights, returned<br />
to former glory. A chair<br />
joined so precise,<br />
its many curved pieces<br />
fitted as one body, turned<br />
from bitten, slivered wood<br />
to shining second life.<br />
The work of his hands<br />
set out on a front porch<br />
to weather wind and rain,<br />
to hold him in contemplation<br />
of the world<br />
he finds before him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Supper</p>
<p>Christ the man<br />
keeps it simple:<br />
snap peas from the vine,<br />
green onions, back-porch mint<br />
torn by the rough handful.<br />
Tossed with a little oil,<br />
dash of salt. A glass of wine.<br />
His knife sings<br />
its thanks to the fork<br />
over the ready plate<br />
rimmed in gold. Oil<br />
graces his beard<br />
glinting in the sun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ablution</p>
<p>Christ the man caught<br />
in morning light, filtered<br />
through thin eggshell<br />
scrim of plastic netting<br />
day&#8217;s first-born thoughts.<br />
Water warms. Steam spirits<br />
his voice out of his breast<br />
collects cascading in alabaster,<br />
beads intimate on olive wood<br />
skin. He knows the deep<br />
bend behind the knees,<br />
the particular crooked<br />
point of elbow. Water<br />
pours out and out<br />
as he counts every hair<br />
on his right hand, engrossed<br />
in the intricacy of flesh.</p>
