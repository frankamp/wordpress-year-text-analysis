				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marrow</p>
<p>Twelve turkey vultures keened<br />
and circled their spiral<br />
staircase slow eyes on the dog<br />
hunting with us the dead<br />
wood and snags along the bank<br />
in this empty land of rim<br />
rock and closed oases, hidden<br />
but for their eyes.<br />
The bone I packed in<br />
on my hip, deer joint<br />
pried loose last fall in autumn&#8217;s<br />
pale glow. Gleaming Bowie blade.<br />
Flesh weighted, packed up, hauled out<br />
in shifts, a last remnant for the dog to gnaw. I thought<br />
of them at the fire, the twelve,<br />
and their fine feathers<br />
we found, gathered in light<br />
handfuls, burned as tinder.<br />
Each brittle hollow filled<br />
with guttering blue heat<br />
held in place a moment longer<br />
before leafing fully into flame<br />
sending sparks out up<br />
into the emptiness above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Water</p>
<p>We boil down to so little:<br />
salt, trace elements<br />
calcified in the soil.<br />
Dust to dust.</p>
<p>Rehydrate<br />
to animate.</p>
<p>We are more<br />
than crystalline.</p>
<p>We live as skinned<br />
sponges. Wrung out<br />
we pale; bloated<br />
we sop.</p>
<p>We require current<br />
to remain</p>
<p>lest we wither<br />
like a creek gone gluch.</p>
<p>Hips and elbows,<br />
sharp teeth, sharp tongues<br />
tent the sail<br />
of the body.</p>
<p>Fear coats the mouth<br />
in dust.</p>
<p>Water water everywhere<br />
but nary a drop.</p>
<p>The sustaining wave<br />
washed out: acres of sand,<br />
white shells glittering,<br />
our own glossy reflection</p>
<p>a pillar<br />
of salt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celery</p>
<p>He must have asked thirty people<br />
for fifty cents to help him<br />
<em>look toward the future</em><br />
though he couldn&#8217;t see straight.<br />
I watched him make his way<br />
towards me, ignored or waved off<br />
by everyone else.<br />
Shuffle step. Lumber. Beard.<br />
Bleary eyed. Retarded? Drunk?<br />
Hard to tell until he was there<br />
in front of me, asking.<br />
I gave him what I had,<br />
which wasn&#8217;t much<br />
besides eye contact<br />
and a bag of celery.<br />
He took it, munching<br />
as he made his rounds.<br />
He drifted off eventually<br />
a little more full of the essential<br />
vitamins and minerals,<br />
a little more prepared<br />
to face the life he&#8217;s in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spectrum</p>
<p>The neighborhood’s alight tonight<br />
with Bird’s singing: shout gerbil<br />
gerbil! from the backyard.<br />
Down the way the corgis<br />
lose their minds. He’s just playing, girls.<br />
Bird’s got ribbons on his legs<br />
that fly when he runs, little flags<br />
like he’s a country making<br />
and remaking borders.<br />
If you see him in line at the store<br />
he stands stiff, eyes pinched shut<br />
with the help of his fingers<br />
and rocks, recites numbers.<br />
Don’t stare. Smile and pass<br />
right on by. He’ll feel you.<br />
He’s a pirate-dinosaur.<br />
Just the other day I found him<br />
on the bridge at the creek<br />
peering at himself peering<br />
at himself. Like he was reading<br />
water or the mind<br />
of the giant pond Koi<br />
that’s just an orange road cone.<br />
He falls into a pit that is him<br />
but can’t know the edges of.<br />
Bangarang! Bangarang, Bird.<br />
If you cup your hands<br />
to your ear you’ll catch more<br />
of what he’s got to give.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solidarity</p>
<p>I took a cue<br />
from the cat<br />
and the beer I drank<br />
in the sun<br />
in the chair<br />
I shared with said cat<br />
and settled down<br />
to doze, head in hand.<br />
But<br />
my body rebelled<br />
at each subtle dip<br />
to viscerally kick me<br />
AWAKE!<br />
I&#8217;ve read that pulse<br />
is my body&#8217;s last<br />
ditch effort<br />
to keep me alive<br />
for my body thinks<br />
of sleep as death.<br />
I like that<br />
my body watches<br />
out for me,<br />
thinking existential<br />
thoughts, even when<br />
I&#8217;m not. Needless<br />
to say I didn&#8217;t nap,<br />
and in solidarity<br />
nudged the cat<br />
out of my lap<br />
so we could see<br />
what we&#8217;d been missing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday</p>
<p>Cobwebbed brown bottle<br />
filled with a spray of paper<br />
flowers and the early light<br />
I&#8217;m struck by. The insistence<br />
of sin again and again. Dead.<br />
Alive. Dead. I can&#8217;t untangle<br />
the inexorable down<br />
to its individual threads, finer<br />
than spider&#8217;s silk, than a cat-hair<br />
shadow left in my lap.<br />
My mind distends, bells<br />
out beyond reason into the fog<br />
of faith where everything is creak<br />
and gray. I wait there<br />
until you come to settle<br />
at my side. None clearer<br />
but now, not alone.</p>

<p>The neighbors<br />
are chipping<br />
their rhododendron hedge.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help<br />
but think of the end<br />
to Fargo.</p>
<p>His lonely foot<br />
jiggling<br />
in the teeth.</p>
<p>Dull winter<br />
snow<br />
petaled red.</p>
<p>The house,<br />
the empty lake<br />
beyond.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that how it is?</p>
<p>Iced over<br />
by the odd<br />
memory flickering.</p>
<p>A scene<br />
forgotten for years<br />
returns.</p>
<p>I bend<br />
to tie my shoe<br />
and lose</p>
<p>myself<br />
in the shadow<br />
I make.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reunion</p>
<p>Bone cancer. His bum luck.<br />
Never baptized but by rain water<br />
and bitters. Cigar smoke, expensive<br />
lavender soap, a weakness<br />
for pistachio ice cream.</p>
<p>The IV drips a rhythm they learn<br />
to count down when he can&#8217;t<br />
speak. Pain. Pain. Pain.<br />
Rest. A pasteled garden<br />
of nurses&#8211;Summer, Rose, Daphne&#8211;<br />
tends his vitals.</p>
<p>Hannity gives way to Maddow<br />
on the sly. Indians home stand.<br />
The Weather Channel, swirling<br />
announcements of flooding<br />
down south. Phone calls made<br />
and relayed. <em>It&#8217;s okay, Pop.</em></p>
<p>Distant family loiters<br />
in the halls. His dying<br />
they take with them<br />
to the hotel, smell it<br />
on their hands.</p>
<p>Drinks while the kids swim.<br />
They take the shape of the sunken<br />
poolside chairs. Stories surface<br />
like stones. One by one<br />
taken into their mouths.<br />
His godawful temper. His love</p>
<p>of the foxtrot and fine wine.<br />
The time he ruined the Buick.<br />
His elegant racism. His work ethic.<br />
The dog shampoo incident.<br />
How all their fingers crook the same.<br />
They laugh and it sounds<br />
as if he&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>The kids swim on.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing to be done.<br />
House packed and boxed,<br />
papers filed, arrangements made.<br />
Waiting in shifts fills every day<br />
to the brim.</p>
<p>Ice chips. Blue sponges.<br />
O2 stats. Wilting flowers<br />
in a plastic vase.<br />
The eroding terrain<br />
of his heartbeat.</p>
<p>When he goes it&#8217;s quiet.<br />
Early. Still. Most asleep<br />
or pacing just outside.<br />
They never heard him<br />
slip away, passing<br />
with a wink and nod.</p>
<p>At the hotel they rise<br />
again. Instant coffee<br />
in paper cups. Old<br />
underwear in the sink.<br />
TVs in their block of rooms<br />
loud with morning<br />
cartoons.</p>
