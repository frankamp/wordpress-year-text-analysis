<p>Christ the man considers<br />
romanesco. The more<br />
he slices fractals, divining<br />
parentage, the more<br />
perplexed. There is no<br />
seeking mystery. There is<br />
no separation it seems<br />
from spindle down<br />
to root. Replication<br />
quick as breathing,<br />
as unthought<br />
before breathing<br />
is what comes<br />
of divination. Only<br />
a holy sense of yes<br />
comes. So. He lays down<br />
the knife. He lays down.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time</p>
<p>Christ the man rises<br />
at the wrong right hour.<br />
At the near curve of the earth<br />
Arizona catches up<br />
to the rest of the country.<br />
Or maybe it&#8217;s the other way.<br />
The birds aren&#8217;t up yet<br />
and a hundred thousand faithful<br />
are early to church. His body<br />
is unexpectedly static<br />
and out of tune.<br />
In the lagging dark<br />
he sets about resetting<br />
the oven and microwave<br />
clocks. The VCR is harder.<br />
The blinking green numbers<br />
bend, send him into <em>déjà vu</em>,<br />
displaced in time. Or out. Whatever.<br />
He lingers in the freeing gap,<br />
at home for once, for a moment.<br />
He declines to wind his watch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dream</p>
<p>Christ the man slings<br />
into the knotted hammock<br />
a hurled stone.<br />
The spruces sway.<br />
Their blue song lulls<br />
him to sleep. He dreams<br />
fitful and smokey.<br />
An ache in his belly,<br />
a moth in his mouth. Caught<br />
in a webbed net, a garment<br />
creeping seamless<br />
as ivy in the trees.<br />
He wakes disheveled,<br />
dry-mouth, unwell<br />
under a blue sky<br />
he blinks to believe<br />
but cannot see the ends of.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladder</p>
<p>Christ the man hums<br />
John Prine all the way<br />
down the mountain.<br />
Woodsmoke lingers<br />
in his wildman hair.<br />
Pine needles line his pockets;<br />
pitch blacks his hands.<br />
Slowing over the deep hole<br />
beneath the bridge he eyes<br />
each green trout huddling<br />
the cutbank, each man<br />
in the current before first light.<br />
Sun-upped evergreens<br />
make a ladder on which angels<br />
ascend and descend. To climb<br />
into an empty endless sky.<br />
Miles to go to a home he feels<br />
not at home in. Below blue fog<br />
rolls heavy in the valley<br />
like a snake uncoiling,<br />
a spirit moving.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Altar</p>
<p>Christ the man spreads<br />
an old blanket and lays out<br />
a million hurts, a curiosity cabinet<br />
of woe. No entry fee to see<br />
what he&#8217;s carried just this day.<br />
He wanders the oddly attired rows,<br />
caressing each item in turn: a lamp<br />
battered in, a broken bell, shattered pieces<br />
of someone&#8217;s wedding china. Section 8 vouchers<br />
banded together. Losing lotto tickets,<br />
bounced checks, report cards, pink slips.<br />
A hundred thousand notes that find their way<br />
into his pocket, cribbed on takeout menus<br />
and medical bills, faded receipts and obits.<br />
Crumpled prayers. No one stops to buy<br />
or even look. No one ever does. Night drops.<br />
The items blur, become indistinct. Piled,<br />
he douses the day&#8217;s take in lighter fluid<br />
and touches off a match. The acrid smoke<br />
stains him, blots out stars. He adds<br />
sandalwood and myrrh, frankincense<br />
for a sweet char. His incense rises<br />
and spreads on the four winds. Soon<br />
the others will come to offer their own<br />
fuel, broken bits suited to the maw.<br />
Each leaves lighter and just as smudged<br />
as he.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ransom</p>
<p>Christ the man offers<br />
to pick up the check,<br />
quick-draw to his hip,<br />
but she declines. As always<br />
he lets her. She worries<br />
up a flock of crows<br />
to nest in her hair.<br />
He draws idly on a napkin.<br />
Their smiles always overlapped.<br />
He speaks in uncertain terms<br />
of things to come,<br />
his finger finding the edge<br />
of the cup. Her eyes trace<br />
uncertain grain splitting<br />
the table between them,<br />
seeking to find where<br />
she might dig it up,<br />
this root of contention.<br />
Her earrings scatter sun<br />
spilling treasure as ransom<br />
but she knows as well as he<br />
there is nothing other to be done.<br />
There never was.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speak</p>
<p>Christ the man speaks<br />
into the sky. His clouds<br />
are more than dinosaurs<br />
and flattened hats. Gold-dust<br />
bees meander by, fresh from the flower.<br />
The winded blade is at his ear.<br />
Many streams inside him sing<br />
his name. He laughs at nothing.<br />
His lunacy is sweetly scandalous;<br />
mothers hushing children,<br />
mistaking grotesque fascination<br />
with recognition. What he says<br />
and in what unknown language<br />
is lost to air, to the million spaces<br />
that make up <em>air</em> and <em>not-air</em>.<br />
His speech weaves a veil.<br />
Gentle your head and lay<br />
beside him, ask who he is<br />
speaking to. He says, I am.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Auroch</p>
<p>Christ the man wonders<br />
off-handed, in the sleeve-tugging way<br />
the mind sometimes makes,<br />
just as he caps the toothpaste<br />
about what it means<br />
to &#8220;shed some light&#8221;.<br />
His stampeding thoughts halt,<br />
revealing an auroch snuffling<br />
in mid-pasture, rutting up the fertile<br />
ground. Brazen black and horned,<br />
a shake of its massive, shaggy head casts off<br />
bits of light cascading like broken water,<br />
brittle, sloughing into piles around his hooves.<br />
Like lightening flaked. Like manna.<br />
A moment taken entirely elsewhere<br />
by the thought of what might be.<br />
A darkened auroch made of light<br />
lingering in a dingy suburban bathroom.<br />
The flutter of joyous surprise that follows<br />
hope also lingers, leaving him<br />
aired out and vital.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Covenant</p>
<p>Christ the man stands<br />
in an urban field,<br />
a weed-filled lot, rampant<br />
with equally urban goats.<br />
A whole herd. He&#8217;s paid<br />
several dollars to be here.<br />
The wind is warm and<br />
the sky holds no threat<br />
or malice. The sounds of cud<br />
and bleating comfort.<br />
Each bright ear tag<br />
is a reminder, a message<br />
to the one who bears it:<br />
<em>you are safe here</em>, it says,<br />
<em>we will not eat you, nor </em><br />
<em>butcher you cross-ways</em><br />
<em>and sprinkle your blood</em><br />
<em>to prove our intent </em><br />
<em>to another. It has been done.</em><br />
<em>It is not done now.</em><br />
The people around him<br />
who have also paid, who might<br />
have paid more, mingle leisurely.<br />
They know nothing of what<br />
the goats know. They know<br />
only warm wind<br />
and the soft sound of bleating.<br />
He smiles to think of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burden</p>
<p>Christ the man sets down<br />
his many keys on the table.<br />
The lights stay off. It&#8217;s this<br />
he wants. Quiet. A breath<br />
of nothing. After a long day<br />
in the world he is bodily<br />
part of, his shoulders ache<br />
with the act of staying upright.<br />
His mind a catacomb he&#8217;s lost in.<br />
But now crickets. Now the cat<br />
gently brushing his leg. The holy<br />
silence made of wind moving tree&#8217;s<br />
budding branches. The hum<br />
of his heart winds down,<br />
finding its own right rhythm,<br />
remembering again what it is<br />
to come and go in prayer.</p>
