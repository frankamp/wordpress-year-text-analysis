				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Skamania Lodge</p>
<p>My wife and I slept in a king-sized bed<br />
with a very lovely Pendleton quilt<br />
that was previously occupied<br />
by thousands of people.</p>
<p>We used the same sheets and pillows.<br />
I made coffee in the bathroom while she dried off<br />
with a towel shared by who knows<br />
how many others.</p>
<p>I imagined all sorts of scenarios playing out<br />
in our back-of-the-lodge suite: lazy nights,<br />
lonely businessmen calling home, lovers’<br />
getaways, a family vacation going south.</p>
<p>Each cycling through the private world<br />
of the others. Starched, pressed, yes, but still:<br />
we leave behind a little of ourselves, held<br />
by the memory-foam mattress, the heavy drapes.</p>
<p>Which, I think, is why I stared so long<br />
at the Gideons Bible in the night stand<br />
I found on accident, looking for the remote<br />
to see if the Saints were winning.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a pair of lacy underwear,<br />
no intimate family photos or favorite terrycloth toy<br />
forgotten in a rush out the door, nothing<br />
to speak of who had passed before,</p>
<p>though that was my first reaction,<br />
intrusion, at the deeper spiritual<br />
implications lying in wait inside<br />
this unassuming bedside drawer.</p>
<p>I wondered if anyone ever reads it,<br />
this little book full of wisdom<br />
and mystery and, for many, anger<br />
enough to ruin any vacation;</p>
<p>are there fingerprints or dog-eared pages?<br />
Bits underlined and memorized? Notes<br />
in the margins asking questions or arguing?<br />
Whole pages torn out in grief or sudden comprehension?</p>
<p>Or do we many thousand strangers share<br />
in common the experience of opening the drawer,<br />
just to see, expecting a hotel notepad, take-out menus<br />
and a phone book full of numbers we&#8217;ll never call</p>
<p>but finding instead this book. I think we look<br />
knowing all along what it is we&#8217;ll find. I did.<br />
Satisfied we close it again, more or less certain<br />
of ourselves, and go wander down to the gift shop.</p>
<p>(Bonus fun-facts I couldn&#8217;t work into the poem about the <a href="http://www.gideons.org/">Gideons</a> via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideons_International">Wikipedia</a>: More than 1.8 billion Bibles and New Testaments have been distributed since 1908. / On average, more than two copies of the Bible are distributed per second through Gideons International. / It is anticipated that the two billionth Scripture will be placed in 2015.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hagiography</p>
<p>sounds a lot like Hey, Geography!<br />
as if some cantankerous cartographer<br />
is getting after his tilted-halo child again,<br />
perhaps for moving a mountain range or<br />
gerrymandering Jefferson and Crook counties<br />
into a three-headed, fire-breathing hodag.</p>
<p>He orders the known world.<br />
His concern is in where, exactly,<br />
each river runs, less the rivers themselves.<br />
He’s an edge man, trading in contours of<br />
stark black lines that define the shape of things;<br />
the interior is someone else’s problem.</p>
<p>No wonder the kid’s no saint. Or is he?</p>

so of course this<br />

Short, sweet<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>//First poem of 2014.//</p>
<p>New Year&#8217;s Day</p>
<p>I saw three deer<br />
as I walked in the cemetery<br />
on the first day of the year.</p>
<p>I wondered if they’re a family<br />
visiting long-buried kin, dead years<br />
before we plotted out this hillside.</p>
<p>I imagined the elders passing on stories<br />
and deeric lore so the younger ones will avoid roads,<br />
cougars and men in orange in November.</p>
<p>But no. Everything they need to know<br />
is written down for them, passed along<br />
intact and exact. No risk of altered fables</p>
<p>that get the berry wrong, extol the henbane<br />
or mushroom you <i>shouldn’t</i> eat. That’s us,<br />
relying on faulty words to keep ourselves alive.</p>
<p>And I? I am death to them, a threat<br />
they turn a wary ear toward<br />
even as they graze, knowing</p>
<p>in a way I never will, death comes.<br />
All they want is a dandelion,<br />
some poa, the sweet inner petal</p>
<p>of a graveside tulip. No note,<br />
just the flower alone<br />
bearing the message.</p>
