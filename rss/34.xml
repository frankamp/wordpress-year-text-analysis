<p>Do not judge a man<br />
By his words<br />
But by his actions.</p>
<p>But what if his best actions<br />
Are the words he makes?<br />
What then?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artistic Pruning</p>
<p>Just a lonely little white sign<br />
with a phone number<br />
and such an odd slogan<br />
alone in an unadorned yard.</p>
<p>I imagined a garage<br />
full of swatches of color,<br />
digits and whole limbs<br />
made of marble or bronze,</p>
<p>entire fourth acts cut<br />
characters running dead lines.<br />
Banker boxes of word confetti,<br />
enjambed last stanzas and lame lyrics.</p>
<p>Stacks of left feet peeled<br />
from all sorts of choreography.<br />
Jars of musical notes clamoring<br />
but for the one full of rests.</p>
<p>If only such a place existed.<br />
Though it&#8217;s probably cold<br />
and a little dusty.<br />
Just a little room</p>
<p>among old bicycle parts,<br />
sundry garden implements,<br />
once-used snow tires<br />
and a rusty barbecue</p>
<p>for a desk and lamp,<br />
a heavy-glass ashtray<br />
and a single seat, a place<br />
to sit and wonder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>purple rain / white guilt<em></em></p>
<p>what right? is what rings<br />
as i walk away<br />
a couple bucks in a jar<br />
a black man his guitar<br />
and a drummer jamming<br />
out Prince covers<br />
to a lunch-time crowd<br />
that could care less</p>
<p>i wish i&#8217;d shaken hands<br />
learned their names<br />
heard a little more<br />
than the songs they love<br />
but no&#8211;guilt toting fear<br />
swoops in to ruin the moment<br />
what right? walk on, man&#8230;</p>
<p>damn they&#8217;re good<br />
and the drummer smiled<br />
attacking his plastic buckets<br />
not because of my money<br />
but for the love<br />
he was lost in<br />
the groove<br />
i&#8217;m the one left stewing<br />
not him, man<br />
he&#8217;s gone</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>poem of opportunity</p>
<p>the folded dollar in my pocket<br />
the chewed up dog collar in the weeds<br />
the kid losing a bloody tooth in the grocery store<br />
the Hawthorne Bridge in a warm wind<br />
the glass of whiskey going down warm<br />
the bend of the river the bend of my back<br />
the pavement grit in my eye<br />
the man in the purple jacket crossing the street<br />
the scrap of verse tugging like a fish on a line<br />
the fresh feeling after the thaw<br />
the way the geese the way the mallards<br />
the flash of a woman I think I knew once<br />
the lights in the house on<br />
the feeling when no no one is home<br />
the hot eye of the stove top<br />
the movement of steam over soup<br />
the mewling of the cat<br />
the collective breath that is worry and relief<br />
the tidings the night brings</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jackal</p>
<p>I ate at them with my eyes.<br />
Devoured their disease.<br />
I breathed their stale scent,<br />
their smoke and sepsis.<br />
I picked apart worn stories.<br />
I sat close, hand in jaundiced hand,<br />
slow pulse still kicking in the wrist.<br />
I asked after kids and family<br />
that never came. I searched<br />
sunken eyes. I could almost<br />
taste it. Almost. No bones to gnaw<br />
but memory: Willy&#8217;s glossy black arm<br />
the flat of his brittle bones nestled<br />
in a faded red sweater. His neat fingernails.<br />
The dying ficus. Withered balloons. Heavy<br />
afternoons barely living in that house.<br />
I left by the backdoor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ice storm</p>
<p>the music fades<br />
each note a strain<br />
silence is the song</p>
<p>at rest a bellied<br />
soundlessness empty<br />
gong of how we hear</p>
<p>so muted our ears<br />
attune anew learn<br />
a different listen</p>
<p>day is long<br />
and night is long</p>
<p>of a sudden crack<br />
sharp edges edging<br />
where void ran on</p>
<p>crash and shatter<br />
folded rills soft<br />
break geometric</p>
<p>violence thaws<br />
the song resumes<br />
inside the world</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cowboy</p>
<p>Creamy broadcloth shirt, Mennonite-make,<br />
spattered in blood. Like his hands. He looks lost<br />
under his flat-brim hat. His partner (father?)<br />
stands. A shame. Nothing to be done. Calf was injured,<br />
boy. She fought. Soaked the tall timothy grass.<br />
He&#8217;s thinking <em>Issac</em>. He&#8217;s thinking <em>God damn it</em>.<br />
They&#8217;ll drag it out behind the barn and burn it<br />
on an altar of mesquite and cardboard.<br />
They&#8217;ll toss the hooves to the dogs.<br />
They&#8217;ll wash up and go back to work.<br />
They&#8217;ll have to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crocus</p>
<p>late night snow fall<br />
found mid-morning<br />
frozen in the side yard<br />
dusted over</p>
<p>broken nose an odd crocus<br />
sharp-angled hips<br />
and fingers crook&#8217;d<br />
in farewell</p>
<p>our bodies are mostly water<br />
frozen crystalline weavings<br />
sliced cross-wise snowflakes<br />
each unique</p>
<p>silent spinning refracting<br />
light glittering in slow descent<br />
to earth under hill at rest<br />
in the side yard</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>snow</p>
<p>smooth it all out, baby<br />
rub down the edges<br />
of street signs, trash cans, hedges<br />
step out on the porch<br />
with your Makers and water<br />
let the fat flakes hiss<br />
on the hotplate<br />
your lips and cheeks are<br />
streetlamp fuzzes a golden bell<br />
the whole world&#8217;s gone under<br />
porch light leaves your shadow<br />
and the smoke from your cigarette<br />
the sharpest things going</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polluting the Data Pool</p>
<p>What&#8217;s about to happen?<br />
I fill out a very specific version of me&#8211;<br />
known name(s), address, DOB, SSN&#8211;<br />
hit send and wait a few months for<br />
what, exactly? A file full of intrigue<br />
and odd cross-checked connections<br />
I&#8217;d never in a million years put together<br />
as worthy of inquiry? Or just a one-pager<br />
detailing my FOIA filing? Is that vain?<br />
I <em>say</em> there&#8217;s no reason for the FBI<br />
or CIA or anyone else (except<br />
Target, Amazon, Apple and the like)<br />
to keep track of me&#8211;but I don&#8217;t mean it,<br />
really. I <em>want</em> to matter, flatter my ego<br />
a little. I marched in a protest, once!<br />
I&#8217;ve signed a petition or two in my time!<br />
Maybe I look like some sort of interloper;<br />
but just enough to be of interest,<br />
not so much to cause arrest. It&#8217;s a fine line<br />
to demand of my government. Take notice<br />
but not too close. Who knows. Maybe<br />
strange cars will linger outside my house,<br />
men in trench coats will visit my friends<br />
and the other end of my phone line<br />
will now hold odd &#8220;empty&#8221; echoes and clicks.<br />
Or maybe in a few months, when I&#8217;ve forgotten<br />
the whole episode, I&#8217;ll receive a plain folder<br />
under my door, empty but for this poem.</p>
